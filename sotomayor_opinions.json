Exercising jurisdiction under\n\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.\n\n       Ms. Jacobs was a part-year resident of Oklahoma in 2018 and 2019. She filed\n\n tax returns and paid Oklahoma income taxes for both years. But the OTC disagreed\n\n with her calculations of what she owed, asserting that (1) for the 2018 tax year, she\n\n\n\n       *\n         After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\n unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral\n argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\n submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent,\n except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It\n may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1\n and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\fAppellate Case: 21-6170    Document: 010110707551        Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 2\n\n\n\n owed an additional $25, and (2) for the 2019 tax year, she was not entitled to the\n\n $209 refund she claimed, and she owed another $134.\n\n       Ms. Jacobs filed suit against the OTC in federal court, complaining that the\n\n OTC had recalculated her taxes. For relief, she asked the court to order the OTC to\n\n issue her a $209 refund for the 2019 tax year and to declare her taxes paid in full for\n\n the 2018 tax year. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the district court\n\n dismissed the suit without prejudice because \u201c[a]t its core, [the] case challenge[d] a\n\n determination of her tax liability by the State of Oklahoma,\u201d R. at 30, and therefore it\n\n was barred by the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.\n\n       We review the dismissal order de novo. See Chamber of Com. of U.S. v.\n\n Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 760-61 (10th Cir. 2010) (de novo review of applicability\n\n of TIA); Kay v. Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007) (de novo review of\n\n dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)). Because Ms. Jacobs proceeds pro se, we\n\n construe her filings liberally. See Diversey v. Schmidly, 738 F.3d 1196, 1199\n\n (10th Cir. 2013).\n\n       Ms. Jacobs asserts the district court erred in dismissing her suit because (1) the\n\n court had federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and (2) the action\n\n was not barred by the TIA. But the TIA may apply even where a complaint suggests\n\n federal-question jurisdiction. See Brooks v. Nance, 801 F.2d 1237, 1239 (10th Cir.\n\n 1986) (\u201cBasing a complaint upon alleged violation of civil rights . . . or of the\n\n Federal Constitution will not avoid the prohibition contained in Section 1341.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fAppellate Case: 21-6170     Document: 010110707551         Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 3\n\n\n\n (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because Ms. Jacobs\u2019 second argument is\n\n dispositive of the appeal, we need not address her first argument.\n\n        The TIA provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or\n\n restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain,\n\n speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d 28 U.S.C.\n\n \u00a7 1341. This provision \u201cerects a broad barrier to the jurisdiction of federal courts.\u201d\n\n Chamber of Com., 594 F.3d at 761; see also Marcus v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Revenue,\n\n 170 F.3d 1305, 1309 n.2 (10th Cir. 1999) (\u201cIn accordance with . . . Supreme Court\n\n precedents, we treat the Tax Injunction Act as a bar to federal jurisdiction over cases\n\n involving the enjoinment, suspension, restraint, levy, or collection of taxes imposed\n\n by states.\u201d). And the TIA bars not only injunctive relief, but also declaratory relief\n\n and damages suits regarding state tax matters. See Marcus, 170 F.3d at 1309;\n\n Brooks, 801 F.2d at 1239.\n\n        Ms. Jacobs\u2019 complaint requests that the district court order the OTC to issue\n\n her a refund for the 2019 tax year and to declare her tax liabilities as paid in full for\n\n the 2018 tax year. Thus, the suit plainly seeks to enjoin or restrain the assessment,\n\n levy, and collection of Oklahoma income tax from Ms. Jacobs for those tax years.\n\n Further, this court previously has determined that Oklahoma\u2019s state courts provide a\n\n plain, speedy and efficient remedy for tax disputes. See Hill v. Kemp, 478 F.3d 1236,\n\n 1253-54 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWe have heard no convincing reason to suppose that\n\n Oklahoma fails to provide its citizens sufficient process for challenging its tax laws;\n\n very much to the contrary.\u201d); Cities Serv. Gas Co. v. Okla. Tax Comm\u2019n, 656 F.2d\n\n                                              3\n\fAppellate Case: 21-6170     Document: 010110707551         Date Filed: 07/08/2022   Page: 4\n\n\n\n 584, 587-88 (10th Cir. 1981) (concluding that Oklahoma\u2019s judicial remedy for tax\n\n disputes sufficed to support application of the TIA). Accordingly, the TIA deprived\n\n the district court of jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n        We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ms. Jacobs\u2019 complaint.\n\n\n                                               Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                               Nancy L.

See R., Vol. I, at 52, 54\n\n                                           2\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570     Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 3\n\n\n\n 323 (Jury Instrs., filed Feb. 15, 2013).\n\n       On February 15, 2013, a jury convicted Mr. Hopkins on the five counts\n\n noted above. On May 28, 2013, the district court sentenced Mr. Hopkins to a total\n\n of 544 months\u2019 imprisonment: 160 months for each of Counts One, Five, and\n\n Seven, all to run concurrently; 84 months for Count Six, to run consecutively; and\n\n 300 months for Count Eight, to run consecutively. Mr. Hopkins appealed from the\n\n district court\u2019s judgment imposing these convictions, but a panel of our Court\n\n affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. See United States v. Hopkins (\u201cHopkins I\u201d),\n\n 608 F. App\u2019x 637 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished).\n\n                                            B\n\n       In 2016, Mr. Hopkins, appearing pro se, filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion,\n\n raising twenty-four separate claims. See United States v. Hopkins (\u201cHopkins II\u201d),\n\n 797 F. App\u2019x 401, 402 n.1 (10th Cir. 2019) (unpublished). Among his numerous\n\n claims, Mr. Hopkins argued that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\n challenge his \u00a7 924(c) convictions in light of Rosemond v. United States, 572 U.S.\n\n 65 (2014), which had been decided during the pendency of Hopkins I.4\n\n\n (alleging, in Counts Five and Seven, that Mr. Hopkins \u201cknowingly, willfully and\n intentionally obstruct[ed], delay[ed] and affect[ed] interstate commerce . . . by\n robbery\u201d).\n       4\n              As the Hopkins II panel explained, the Supreme Court in Rosemond\n \u201cheld that a defendant cannot be convicted of aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c)\n violation unless he has advance knowledge that one of his confederates will carry\n a firearm and that a trial court errs by giving an aiding-and-abetting jury\n\n                                            3\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022   Page: 4\n\n\n\n Effectively, Mr. Hopkins argued that his \u00a7 924(c) convictions were premised on\n\n aiding-and-abetting liability; the trial court had given an erroneous instruction in\n\n light of Rosemond; and appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the Rosemond issue\n\n amounted to ineffective assistance.\n\n       On July 27, 2017, the district court denied Mr. Hopkins\u2019s motion and also\n\n denied him a COA. In doing so, the district court found unpersuasive Mr.\n\n Hopkins\u2019s Rosemond argument. While the district court agreed with Mr. Hopkins\n\n that he \u201ccould not be convicted for aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) violation under\n\n Rosemond,\u201d it found any instructional error harmless because Mr. Hopkins \u201cwas\n\n properly convicted of aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) violation under Pinkerton v.\n\n United States.\u201d5 R., Vol. VI, at 108 (Dist. Ct. Order, entered Jul. 27, 2017). More\n\n specifically, in light of the facts of Mr. Hopkins\u2019s case, the district court\n\n concluded it was \u201centirely foreseeable that one or more of [Mr. Hopkins\u2019s]\n\n accomplices would bring a firearm to . . . [a] robbery and brandish it in\n\n furtherance thereof.\u201d Id. at 109. Thus, the court rejected Mr. Hopkins\u2019s argument\n\n\n\n\n instruction that fails to account for the advance-knowledge requirement.\u201d Hopkins\n II, F. App\u2019x at 402 (citing Rosemond, 572 U.S. at 77\u201378, 81).\n       5\n               \u201cThe Pinkerton doctrine holds each member of a conspiracy legally\n responsible for the reasonably foreseeable crimes of fellow conspirators committed\n in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d United States v.

P. 60(b),\u201d broadly challenging the\n\n district court\u2019s original denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion and contending that the court\n\n had applied incorrect precedent and otherwise erred in denying his ineffective\n\n assistance of appellate counsel claim based on Rosemond. R., Vol. VI, at 110\u201315\n\n (Mot. Pursuant to Rule 60(b), filed May 28, 2019). By minute order, the district\n\n court summarily denied Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and subsequently denied\n\n his request for a COA. See id. at 134 (Minute Order, entered June 4, 2019); see\n\n also Hopkins II, 797 F. App\u2019x at 403.\n\n       Mr. Hopkins appealed, and a panel of our Court concluded that his Rule\n\n 60(b) motion should have been dismissed as an unauthorized second or successive\n\n \u00a7 2255 motion.

Following\n\n the panel\u2019s mandate, the district court vacated its previous denial of the Rule 60(b)\n\n motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. See Order, United States v. Hill,\n\n No. 12-CR-00050-GKF (N.D. Okla. Apr. 7, 2020), Doc. No. 846 (vacating district\n\n court\u2019s previous denial of Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and dismissing it for\n\n lack of jurisdiction); see also R., Vol. VII, at 31 (district court docket sheet\n\n showing dismissal of Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion).6 Mr. Hopkins did not,\n\n however, initiate further action to pursue his Rosemond-based claim.\n\n                                            D\n\n       On April 24, 2020, Mr. Hopkins sought permission from this Court to file a\n\n successive \u00a7 2255 motion. A panel granted Mr. Hopkins permission to file such a\n\n motion to challenge his \u00a7 924(c) convictions and sentences on the basis of the\n\n Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Davis, --- U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 2319\n\n (2019).

The statute defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense\n\n that is a felony and . . . (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened\n\n use of physical force against the person or property of another [i.e., the force or\n\n elements clause], or (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical\n\n force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of\n\n committing the offense [i.e., the residual clause].\u201d Id. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u2013(B). Davis\n\n invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\u2014the residual clause\u2014concluding that it was\n\n unconstitutionally vague, which left \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the force or elements clause,\n\n as the only applicable definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the statute. See\n\n Davis, 139 S. Ct. at 2336.\n\n       Using the Supreme Court\u2019s Davis decision, Mr. Hopkins subsequently filed\n\n his second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that Davis\u2019s invalidation of\n\n \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause rendered his own \u00a7 924(c) convictions unconstitutional.\n\n However, on July 20, 2020, the district court dismissed or, in the alternative,\n\n denied Mr. Hopkins\u2019s second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and did not issue a\n\n COA. See R., Vol. VII, at 33\u201338 (Dist. Ct. Order, entered Jul. 20, 2020). In\n\n                                            7\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570       Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 8\n\n\n\n pertinent part, the court concluded that, because \u201ccourts have consistently held that\n\n a Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under [\u00a7] 924(c)\u2019s elements clause,\u201d\n\n Mr. Hopkins \u201cfail[ed] to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his\n\n conviction rests on \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s unconstitutional residual clause.\u201d Id. at 37.\n\n Accordingly, the court dismissed Mr. Hopkins\u2019s motion because it could not \u201crely\n\n on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Davis\u201d and, therefore, did not \u201csatisfy the\n\n requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).\u201d Id. Alternatively, the court denied the\n\n motion on the merits \u201cfor the same reasons because he fails to show it is more\n\n likely than not that his [\u00a7] 924(c) conviction rests on the unconstitutional residual\n\n clause.\u201d Id.\n\n                                           E\n\n       Shortly thereafter, on August 3, 2020, Mr. Hopkins filed in the district court\n\n a motion to reconsider its decision pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\n\n Procedure 4(c)(1) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). Specifically, Mr.\n\n Hopkins asked the court to reopen and re-enter its July 27, 2017, judgment, which\n\n rendered final the rejection of his first \u00a7 2255 motion, so that he could file a\n\n timely notice of appeal challenging that ruling.7 See id. at 40\u201349 (Pet.\u2019s Mot.\n\n Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1) & Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), filed Aug. 3,\n\n 2020). By way of this motion, Mr. Hopkins effectively tried to \u201creset[]\u201d the time\n\n\n       7\n             This motion was dated July 21, 2020, and was entered in the district\n court\u2019s docket on August 3, 2020.\n\n                                            8\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 9\n\n\n\n period for appealing from the district court\u2019s denial of his first \u00a7 2255 motion,\n\n arguing he had timely placed his notice of appeal in the prison mail system in\n\n 2017, but that the notice and envelope were returned to him, undelivered, in June\n\n 2020, three years later. Id. at 40; see also id. at 40\u201342. Mr. Hopkins attached a\n\n sworn declaration to his motion and contended that he had established good cause\n\n to excuse this delay and reopen the district court\u2019s July 2017 order and judgment\n\n denying his first \u00a7 2255 motion. See id. at 42, 47.\n\n       On August 11, 2020, the district court denied Mr. Hopkins\u2019s motion. See id.\n\n at 50\u201354 (Dist. Ct. Order, dated Aug. 11, 2020). The court explained that, under\n\n the prison mailbox rule, an inmate can establish timely filing of a notice of appeal\n\n \u201cby either (1) alleging and proving that he . . . made timely use of the prison\u2019s\n\n legal mail system . . ., or (2) . . . by timely use of the prison\u2019s regular mail system\n\n in combination with a notarized statement or a declaration under penalty of perjury\n\n of the date on which the documents were given to prison authorities and attesting\n\n that postage was prepaid.\u201d Id. at 53 (quoting Prince v. Philpot, 420 F.3d 1158,\n\n 1166 (10th Cir. 2005)). The district court found that Mr. Hopkins failed to make\n\n either of these showings and denied the motion.\n\n                                           ***\n\n       Mr. Hopkins submitted his timely notice of appeal, which was filed on\n\n September 8, 2020.

See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 3\u201310. Yet construed\n\n  liberally, Mr. Hopkins\u2019s filings also conceivably seek a COA to challenge the\n\n  district court\u2019s denial of his August 3, 2020, Rule 60(b)(6) motion, in which Mr.\n\n  Hopkins invoked the prison mailbox rule with the objective of getting the court to\n\n  reenter its judgment so that he could appeal from the court\u2019s denial of his first\n\n  \u00a7 2255 motion. However, in his opening brief, Mr. Hopkins reargues only the\n\n  merits of his first \u00a7 2255 motion, which recall was a Rosemond-based ineffective\n\n  assistance of appellate counsel claim. See id. at 10\u201314.\n\n                                            II\n\n        Mr. Hopkins mailed a notice of appeal that was filed on September 8, 2020.\n\n  Id. at 55. He must obtain a COA to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his\n\n  \u00a7 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); Clark v. Oklahoma, 468 F.3d 711,\n\n  713 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cA COA is a jurisdictional pre-requisite to our review.\u201d\n\n  (citing Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 323 (2003))). We may grant a COA\n\n  only if Mr. Hopkins \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a\n\n  constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In its seminal decision, Slack v.\n\n  McDaniel, the Supreme Court shed light on the showing required to secure a COA:\n\n                      Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims\n               on the merits, the showing required to satisfy \u00a7 2253(c) is\n               straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable\n               jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the\n               constitutional claims debatable or wrong. The issue becomes\n\n                                                 10\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022       Page: 11\n\n\n\n                somewhat more complicated where, as here, the district court\n                dismisses the petition based on procedural grounds. We hold as\n                follows: When the district court denies a habeas petition on\n                procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying\n                constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner\n                shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable\n                whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a\n                constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it\n                debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural\n                ruling.\n\n  529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\n        More specifically, because the COA inquiry \u201cis not coextensive with a\n\n  merits analysis,\u201d the \u201conly question\u201d at the COA stage \u201cis whether the applicant\n\n  has shown that \u2018jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution\n\n  . . . or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve\n\n  encouragement to proceed further.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773 (2017)\n\n  (quoting Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 327). In fact, if a court of appeals \u201cfirst decid[es]\n\n  the merits of an appeal, and then justif[ies] its denial of a COA based on its\n\n  adjudication of the actual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without\n\n  jurisdiction.\u201d Id. (quoting Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 336\u201337). Notably, in the Rule\n\n  60(b) context, a \u201cfederal habeas court\u2019s ruling on procedural issues . . . should be\n\n  treated as [based on] a true 60(b) motion,\u201d and thus \u201ca COA is required to appeal\n\n  from the denial\u201d of relief. Spitznas v. Boone, 464 F.3d 1213, 1216, 1218 (10th\n\n  Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570       Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 12\n\n\n\n                                           III\n\n        Mr. Hopkins\u2019s request for a COA centers on the district court\u2019s denial of his\n\n  authorized, successive \u00a7 2255 motion, purportedly based on Davis. When\n\n  construed liberally (in truth, generously), see, e.g., Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d\n\n  1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991), Mr. Hopkins\u2019s notice of appeal conceivably also\n\n  could be read as seeking a COA to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his\n\n  August 3, 2020, Rule 60(b)(6) motion\u2014i.e., the order which dealt with Mr.\n\n  Hopkins\u2019s claim that he intended to timely appeal his first \u00a7 2255 motion in 2017\n\n  but the notice of appeal was lost in the mail and returned to him only in June\n\n  2020. In any event, we deny Mr. Hopkins a COA and dismiss this matter.\n\n                                            A\n\n        Mr. Hopkins seeks a COA relating to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his\n\n  authorized, successive \u00a7 2255 motion. As narrated above, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)\n\n  proscribes using or carrying a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of\n\n  violence or drug trafficking crime\u201d or possessing a firearm \u201cin furtherance of any\n\n  such crime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). After the Supreme Court issued its\n\n  decision in Davis, the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was effectively\n\n  limited to the force or elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2014that is, \u201can offense that is a\n\n  felony and . . . (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\n\n  physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d Id. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A); see\n\n  Davis, 139 S. Ct. at 2336.\n\n                                            12\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022   Page: 13\n\n\n\n        Mr. Hopkins contends that, in light of Davis, his \u00a7 924(c) convictions\n\n  cannot stand because Hobbs Act robbery is not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d See Aplt.\u2019s\n\n  Opening Br. at 3\u201310. As Mr. Hopkins reasons, with Hobbs Act robbery failing to\n\n  qualify under the elements clause, and with Davis having rendered the statute\u2019s\n\n  residual clause constitutionally infirm, his \u00a7 924(c) convictions lack a predicate\n\n  \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and, therefore, those convictions, and their attendant\n\n  sentences, must be vacated. See id. at 3\u20137 (arguing that Hobbs Act robbery is not\n\n  categorically a crime of violence under the elements clause); id. at 7\u201310\n\n  (explaining that the residual clause is unconstitutional).\n\n        Unfortunately for Mr. Hopkins, his argument stands on an incorrect legal\n\n  premise: that is to say, he relies on the premise that Hobbs Act robbery is not a\n\n  crime of violence under the elements clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). However, we have\n\n  held in precedential authority to the contrary\u2014specifically, that Hobbs Act robbery\n\n  is, categorically, a crime of violence under the elements clause. In United States\n\n  v. Melgar-Cabrera, we were faced with this precise question\u2014i.e., whether Hobbs\n\n  Act robbery is a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s elements clause\u2014and we\n\n  resolved it in no uncertain terms, by employing the categorical approach to\n\n  \u201cconclu[de] that Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under the elements\n\n  clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3).\u201d 892 F.3d 1053, 1060 n.4 (10th Cir. 2018); see United\n\n  States v.

The defendant\n  in Melgar-Cabrera made two arguments \u201cfor why Hobbs Act robbery fail[ed] to\n  constitute a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u201d: (1) that the \u201cforce\u201d required\n  to commit Hobbs Act robbery need not be \u201cviolent force,\u201d whereas the \u201cphysical\n  force\u201d required for \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) must be \u201cviolent force,\u201d and (2) that\n  \u201cunlawfully taking a victim\u2019s property against his or her will \u2018by means of . . .\n  fear of injury\u2019 does not require the attempted or threatened use of physical force.\u201d\n  Melgar-Cabrera, 892 F.3d at 1061 (omission in original).

Walker, 990 F.3d 316, 325,\n\n  325 n.11 (3d Cir. 2021) (noting that \u201c[e]very court of appeals to consider the issue\n\n  has held that Hobbs Act robbery is . . . a crime of violence for purposes of [the\n\n  force or elements clause of] \u00a7 924(c)\u201d; agreeing with this conclusion; and citing, in\n\n  addition to Melgar-Cabrera, published caselaw from the First, Second, Fourth,\n\n  Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits); see also United States\n\n  v. Nguyen, 845 F. App\u2019x 791, 792 (10th Cir. 2021) (unpublished) (\u201cMr. Nguyen\n\n  argues that Hobbs Act robbery does not constitute a crime of violence under 18\n\n\n\n\n  that the \u201cforce element\u201d in the Hobbs Act robbery statute \u201ccan only be satisfied by\n  violent force.\u201d Id. at 1065 (emphasis added). As for the second argument, we\n  determined that our decision in United States v. Ontiveros, 875 F.3d 533 (10th Cir.\n  2017), \u201cforeclosed\u201d any argument that \u201ccommitting Hobbs Act robbery by putting\n  someone in fear of injury does not necessarily constitute the threatened use of\n  physical force because it can be done through indirect force.\u201d Melgar-Cabrera,\n  892 F.3d at 1066. Our prior rejection of this second argument is particularly\n  important here, where Mr. Hopkins makes an analogous\u2014and analogously\n  unavailing\u2014argument; he avers Hobbs Act robbery does not categorically qualify\n  as a crime of violence because it can be committed \u201cby causing fear of future\n  injury to property, which does not require \u2018physical force\u2019\u201d within \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s\n  meaning. Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 3\u20134.\n        9\n                In June 2022, the Supreme Court held in United States v. Taylor, ---\n  U.S. ----, 142 S. Ct. 2015, 2022 WL 2203334 (2022), that attempted Hobbs Act\n  robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Because, as\n  we previous noted, see supra note 3, Mr. Hopkins was not charged with attempted\n  Hobbs Act robbery in Counts Five and Seven, Taylor\u2019s holding is irrelevant to Mr.\n  Hopkins\u2019s request for a COA. Cf. Taylor, 2022 WL 2203334, at *4 (\u201cWhatever\n  one might say about completed Hobbs Act robbery, attempted Hobbs Act robbery\n  does not satisfy the elements clause.\u201d).\n\n                                           15\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 16\n\n\n\n  U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). He bases this argument on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion\n\n  in United States v. Davis, . . . . In our view, however, any reasonable jurist would\n\n  reject this argument because Hobbs Act robbery clearly satisfies the elements\n\n  clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\u201d).\n\n        For example, in Jefferson I, the defendant \u201cappear[ed] to suggest the taking\n\n  of property via \u2018fear of injury\u2019 d[id] not involve physical force and therefore\n\n  Hobbs Act robbery does not contain a force element\u201d\u2014and, more specifically, that\n\n  \u201cinterpret[ing] the phrase \u2018fear of injury\u2019 as requiring the \u2018threatened use of\n\n  physical force\u2019 would render the phrase impermissibly superfluous because the\n\n  statute already prohibits taking property from the victim against his will via\n\n  \u2018threatened force.\u2019\u201d Jefferson I, 911 F.3d at 1298. We found this position \u201ctoo\n\n  ambitious,\u201d and incompatible with Melgar-Cabrera. Id. Unimpressed with the\n\n  defendant\u2019s statutory interpretation arguments, we observed that, in the case of the\n\n  Hobbs Act, the statute \u201cprohibits . . . robbery by \u2018threatened force,\u2019 which\n\n  overlaps with robbery by \u2018fear of injury,\u2019\u201d and it also \u201cprohibits robbery by \u2018actual\n\n  . . . force,\u2019 which overlaps with robbery by \u2018violence.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1298\u201399 (second\n\n  omission in original). Thus, \u201c[t]aken in context, one thing is clear\u201d: by way of the\n\n  Hobbs Act, \u201cCongress sought to prohibit the taking of property from a victim\n\n  against his will by actual or threatened use of physical force\u201d\u2014and \u201c[t]hat satisfies\n\n  \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\u201d Id.\n\n        Mr. Hopkins cites United States v. Bowen, 936 F.3d 1091 (10th Cir. 2019),\n\n                                            16\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 17\n\n\n\n  to further advocate for his position. Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 6\u20137. But this line of\n\n  attack also fails. We already have stated that Bowen does not call into question\n\n  Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding that Hobbs Act robbery is categorically a crime of\n\n  violence. See Jefferson II, 989 F.3d at 1175 n.1. In Jefferson II, the defendant\n\n  \u201cargue[d] . . . Bowen . . . [was] an intervening decision that overruled our holding\n\n  in . . . Melgar-Cabrera . . . that Hobbs Act robbery is categorically a crime of\n\n  violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\u201d Id. Our Court noted that, assuming\n\n  that the issue was within the scope of the remand at issue, \u201cBowen had no such\n\n  effect.\u201d Id. We explained that, \u201c[i]n Bowen, we held the federal\n\n  witness-retaliation statute . . . does not qualify as a crime of violence under\n\n  \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) because it includes witness retaliation through non-violent property\n\n  damage,\u201d such as \u201cspray painting a car.\u201d Id. (emphasis omitted). \u201cBut the same is\n\n  not true of Hobbs Act robbery,\u201d which \u201cnecessarily entails the use or threatened\n\n  use of violent force against a person or property.\u201d Id. (emphasis omitted). In\n\n  other words, \u201c[w]ithout violent force, there is no Hobbs Act robbery and no \u2018crime\n\n  of violence.\u2019\u201d Id.; see also Nguyen, 845 F. App\u2019x at 792\u201393 (applying Melgar-\n\n  Cabrera to hold that Hobbs Act robbery could \u201conly be satisfied by violent force\u201d\n\n  and is a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) (quoting United States v. Nguyen,\n\n  744 F. App\u2019x 550, 552 (10th Cir. 2018) (unpublished))). Accordingly, Bowen did\n\n  not disturb Melgar-Cabrera, and Mr. Hopkins\u2019s reliance on the case is unavailing.\n\n        Thus, in light of Melgar-Cabrera and subsequent, relevant caselaw, Mr.\n\n                                             17\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570        Date Filed: 07/08/2022   Page: 18\n\n\n\n  Hopkins has not\u2014and cannot\u2014show that reasonable jurists would debate or find\n\n  incorrect the district court\u2019s dismissal of his second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n\n  Accordingly, a COA is not warranted as to this issue.\n\n                                             B\n\n        Construing Mr. Hopkins\u2019s notice of appeal liberally, it is conceivable that\n\n  Mr. Hopkins also seeks a COA with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his\n\n  August 3, 2020, Rule 60(b)(6) motion. However, insofar as he does seek a COA\n\n  on this ground, Mr. Hopkins has completely failed to show that reasonable jurists\n\n  could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we deny\n\n  any such COA request.\n\n        Specifically, along with his notice of appeal, Mr. Hopkins attached a\n\n  document styled \u201cAppellant\u2019s Show Cause Motion Pursuant to the \u2018Prison\n\n  Mailbox\u2019 Rule And Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1).\u201d R., Vol. VII, at 56\u201358 (Ex. 1 to\n\n  Notice of Appeal, filed Sept. 28, 2020). He also attached a supporting declaration\n\n  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 and the purported envelope in which the original\n\n  notice of appeal was mailed back in 2017. Id. at 59\u201362 (Pet.\u2019s Decl., dated Jul.\n\n  21, 2020). Both of these documents were provided to the district court alongside\n\n  his August 3, 2020, Rule 60(b)(6) motion. See id. at 40\u201349. Effectively, Mr.\n\n  Hopkins largely copied and pasted his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, restyled it as a \u201cShow\n\n  Cause\u201d motion, and attached it, along with the declaration he previously sent to\n\n  the district court, to the notice of appeal that he mailed.\n\n                                             18\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086      Document: 010110707570      Date Filed: 07/08/2022       Page: 19\n\n\n\n        However, critically, Mr. Hopkins offers no discussion of the district court\u2019s\n\n  denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion in his opening brief. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at\n\n  10\u201314. Indeed, Mr. Hopkins in his opening brief utters not one word about the\n\n  district court\u2019s denial of this motion. Accordingly, he has waived any arguments\n\n  challenging this denial. It is well-established that \u201c[i]ssues not raised in [an\n\n  appellant\u2019s] opening brief are deemed abandoned or waived,\u201d and \u201c[t]his\n\n  briefing-waiver rule applies equally to arguments that are inadequately presented\n\n  in an opening brief.\u201d Sawyers v. Norton, 962 F.3d 1270, 1286 (10th Cir. 2020)\n\n  (first quoting Tran v. Trs. of State Colls. in Colo., 355 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir.\n\n  2004); and then quoting United States v. Walker, 918 F.3d 1134, 1151 (10th Cir.\n\n  2019)). We likewise hold pro se litigants to this standard. See United States v.\n\n  Banks, 884 F.3d 998, 1024 (10th Cir. 2018) (\u201cWe aren\u2019t required to fill in the\n\n  blanks of a litigant\u2019s inadequate brief.\u201d); Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &\n\n  Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[T]he court cannot take on the\n\n  responsibility of serving as the litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and\n\n  searching the record.\u201d).\n\n        In pursuing a COA, Mr. Hopkins would need to demonstrate how or why the\n\n  district court erred in its denial of the Rule 60(b)(6) motion. That he has not done.\n\n  Cf. Nixon v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 784 F.3d 1364, 1366 (10th Cir. 2015) (\u201cThe\n\n  first task of an appellant is to explain to us why the district court\u2019s decision was\n\n  wrong. Recitation of a tale of apparent injustice may assist in that task, but it\n\n                                             19\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086     Document: 010110707570         Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 20\n\n\n\n  cannot substitute for legal argument. . . . [Appellant] utterly fails . . . to explain\n\n  what was wrong with the reasoning that the district court relied on in reaching its\n\n  decision. As a result, we . . . affirm[] the judgment below.\u201d); Hernandez v.\n\n  Starbuck, 69 F.3d 1089, 1093 (10th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBecause the appellant comes to\n\n  the court of appeals as the challenger, he bears the burden of demonstrating the\n\n  alleged error and the precise relief sought. A court of appeals is not required to\n\n  manufacture an appellant\u2019s \u2018argument on appeal when it has failed in its burden to\n\n  draw our attention to the error below.\u2019\u201d (citations omitted) (quoting Nat\u2019l\n\n  Commodity & Barter Ass\u2019n v. Gibbs, 886 F.2d 1240, 1244 (10th Cir. 1989))).\n\n  Given Mr. Hopkins\u2019s total failure to discuss the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule\n\n  60(b)(6) motion in his opening brief, insofar as Mr. Hopkins seeks a COA to\n\n  challenge this denial, we deny it.\n\n         Notably, instead of addressing the court\u2019s procedural denial of his 60(b)(6)\n\n  motion, Mr. Hopkins focuses in his opening brief on re-litigating the merits of his\n\n  claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, based on counsel\u2019s failure, in\n\n  light of Rosemond, to challenge his convictions\u2014a theory Mr. Hopkins brought in\n\n  his first \u00a7 2255 motion. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 10\u201314 (arguing in support of\n\n  the applicability of Rosemond to overturn his convictions). To the extent that this\n\n  line of argument was intended to bolster Mr. Hopkins\u2019s conceivable COA request\n\n  regarding the court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, it does not avail Mr.\n\n  Hopkins, in light of his complete failure to challenge the procedural ground for the\n\n                                              20\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570       Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 21\n\n\n\n  district court\u2019s denial of that motion. But it is perhaps more likely that Mr.\n\n  Hopkins tacitly seeks to resurrect the Rosemond merits attack of his first \u00a7 2255\n\n  motion. If so, we decline to consider it. As we made clear in Hopkins II, such an\n\n  attack would effectively constitute a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion for which\n\n  Mr. Hopkins has not properly sought authority from this Court. See Hopkins II,\n\n  797 F. App\u2019x at 403. Mr. Hopkins had the opportunity to seek such authority after\n\n  the district court dismissed his May 2019 Rule 60(b) motion concerning his\n\n  Rosemond claim, and he took no further action. We decline to construe this\n\n  argument in his opening brief as a motion seeking such authority now. Cf. United\n\n  States v. Nelson, 465 F.3 1145, 1149 (10th Cir. 006) (\u201ctreat[ing] [prisoner\u2019s] notice\n\n  of appeal and appellate brief as an implied application to this court for leave to\n\n  file a second \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d).\n\n        In sum, we recognize that it is conceivable that Mr. Hopkins also seeks a\n\n  COA to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, invoking\n\n  the prison mailbox rule. If so, Mr. Hopkins cannot prevail because he has waived\n\n  any argument challenging the correctness of the court\u2019s denial by omitting it from\n\n  his opening brief. Therefore, it ineluctably follows that Mr. Hopkins cannot\n\n  demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate the correctness of the court\u2019s Rule\n\n  60(b)(6) ruling, nor show that a COA is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086   Document: 010110707570   Date Filed: 07/08/2022   Page: 22\n\n\n\n                                        IV\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Mr. Hopkins\u2019s request for a COA and\n\n  DISMISS this matter.\n\n                                      ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                      Jerome A.

In doing so, the district court found unpersuasive Mr.\n\n Hopkins\u2019s Rosemond argument. While the district court agreed with Mr. Hopkins\n\n that he \u201ccould not be convicted for aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) violation under\n\n Rosemond,\u201d it found any instructional error harmless because Mr. Hopkins \u201cwas\n\n properly convicted of aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) violation under Pinkerton v.\n\n United States.\u201d5 R., Vol. VI, at 108 (Dist.

More\n\n specifically, in light of the facts of Mr. Hopkins\u2019s case, the district court\n\n concluded it was \u201centirely foreseeable that one or more of [Mr. Hopkins\u2019s]\n\n accomplices would bring a firearm to . . . [a] robbery and brandish it in\n\n furtherance thereof.\u201d Id. at 109.

R., Vol. VI, at 110\u201315\n\n (Mot. Pursuant to Rule 60(b), filed May 28, 2019). By minute order, the district\n\n court summarily denied Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and subsequently denied\n\n his request for a COA. See id. at 134 (Minute Order, entered June 4, 2019); see\n\n also Hopkins II, 797 F.

See Hopkins II, 797 F. App\u2019x at 403.

Following\n\n the panel\u2019s mandate, the district court vacated its previous denial of the Rule 60(b)\n\n motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. See Order, United States v. Hill,\n\n No. 12-CR-00050-GKF (N.D. Okla. Apr. 7, 2020), Doc. No. 846 (vacating district\n\n court\u2019s previous denial of Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and dismissing it for\n\n lack of jurisdiction); see also R., Vol. VII, at 31 (district court docket sheet\n\n showing dismissal of Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion).6 Mr. Hopkins did not,\n\n however, initiate further action to pursue his Rosemond-based claim.\n\n                                            D\n\n       On April 24, 2020, Mr. Hopkins sought permission from this Court to file a\n\n successive \u00a7 2255 motion.

He bases this argument on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion\n\n  in United States v. Davis, . . . . In our view, however, any reasonable jurist would\n\n  reject this argument because Hobbs Act robbery clearly satisfies the elements\n\n  clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\u201d).\n\n        For example, in Jefferson I, the defendant \u201cappear[ed] to suggest the taking\n\n  of property via \u2018fear of injury\u2019 d[id] not involve physical force and therefore\n\n  Hobbs Act robbery does not contain a force element\u201d\u2014and, more specifically, that\n\n  \u201cinterpret[ing] the phrase \u2018fear of injury\u2019 as requiring the \u2018threatened use of\n\n  physical force\u2019 would render the phrase impermissibly superfluous because the\n\n  statute already prohibits taking property from the victim against his will via\n\n  \u2018threatened force.\u2019\u201d Jefferson I, 911 F.3d at 1298. We found this position \u201ctoo\n\n  ambitious,\u201d and incompatible with Melgar-Cabrera. Id. Unimpressed with the\n\n  defendant\u2019s statutory interpretation arguments, we observed that, in the case of the\n\n  Hobbs Act, the statute \u201cprohibits . . . robbery by \u2018threatened force,\u2019 which\n\n  overlaps with robbery by \u2018fear of injury,\u2019\u201d and it also \u201cprohibits robbery by \u2018actual\n\n  . . . force,\u2019 which overlaps with robbery by \u2018violence.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1298\u201399 (second\n\n  omission in original). Thus, \u201c[t]aken in context, one thing is clear\u201d: by way of the\n\n  Hobbs Act, \u201cCongress sought to prohibit the taking of property from a victim\n\n  against his will by actual or threatened use of physical force\u201d\u2014and \u201c[t]hat satisfies\n\n  \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\u201d Id.\n\n        Mr. Hopkins cites United States v.

He also attached a supporting declaration\n\n  pursuant to </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and the purported envelope in which the original\n\n  notice of appeal was mailed back in 2017. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 59\u201362 (Pet.\u2019s Decl., dated Jul.\n\n  21, 2020).

See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 40\u201349. Effectively, Mr.\n\n  Hopkins largely copied and pasted his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, restyled it as a \u201cShow\n\n  Cause\u201d motion, and attached it, along with the declaration he previously sent to\n\n  the district court, to the notice of appeal that he mailed.\n\n                                             18\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086      Document: 010110707570      Date Filed: 07/08/2022       Page: 19\n\n\n\n        However, critically, Mr. Hopkins offers no discussion of the district court\u2019s\n\n  denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion in his opening brief. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at\n\n  10\u201314. Indeed, Mr. Hopkins in his opening brief utters not one word about the\n\n  district court\u2019s denial of this motion. Accordingly, he has waived any arguments\n\n  challenging this denial. It is well-established that \u201c[i]ssues not raised in [an\n\n  appellant\u2019s] opening brief are deemed abandoned or waived,\u201d and \u201c[t]his\n\n  briefing-waiver rule applies equally to arguments that are inadequately presented\n\n  in an opening brief.\u201d Sawyers v.

See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 10\u201314 (arguing in support of\n\n  the applicability of Rosemond to overturn his convictions). To the extent that this\n\n  line of argument was intended to bolster Mr. Hopkins\u2019s conceivable COA request\n\n  regarding the court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, it does not avail Mr.\n\n  Hopkins, in light of his complete failure to challenge the procedural ground for the\n\n                                              20\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086    Document: 010110707570       Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 21\n\n\n\n  district court\u2019s denial of that motion. But it is perhaps more likely that Mr.\n\n  Hopkins tacitly seeks to resurrect the Rosemond merits attack of his first \u00a7 2255\n\n  motion. If so, we decline to consider it. As we made clear in Hopkins II, such an\n\n  attack would effectively constitute a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion for which\n\n  Mr. Hopkins has not properly sought authority from this Court. See Hopkins II,\n\n  797 F. App\u2019x at 403. Mr. Hopkins had the opportunity to seek such authority after\n\n  the district court dismissed his May 2019 Rule 60(b) motion concerning his\n\n  Rosemond claim, and he took no further action. We decline to construe this\n\n  argument in his opening brief as a motion seeking such authority now. Cf. United\n\n  States v. Nelson, 465 F.3 1145, 1149 (10th Cir. 006) (\u201ctreat[ing] [prisoner\u2019s] notice\n\n  of appeal and appellate brief as an implied application to this court for leave to\n\n  file a second \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d).\n\n        In sum, we recognize that it is conceivable that Mr. Hopkins also seeks a\n\n  COA to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, invoking\n\n  the prison mailbox rule. If so, Mr. Hopkins cannot prevail because he has waived\n\n  any argument challenging the correctness of the court\u2019s denial by omitting it from\n\n  his opening brief. Therefore, it ineluctably follows that Mr. Hopkins cannot\n\n  demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate the correctness of the court\u2019s Rule\n\n  60(b)(6) ruling, nor show that a COA is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fAppellate Case: 20-5086   Document: 010110707570   Date Filed: 07/08/2022   Page: 22\n\n\n\n                                        IV\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Mr. Hopkins\u2019s request for a COA and\n\n  DISMISS this matter.\n\n                                      ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                      Jerome A.

Background\n\n       In January 2020, North Dakota law enforcement executed a search warrant at a\n\n residence based on a report from Tumblr, a social networking website, that child sexual\n\n abuse material had been uploaded from that location. In particular, the owner of that\n\n Tumblr account sent an image depicting the sexual exploitation of a six-year-old. North\n\n Dakota law enforcement reviewed the Tumblr account and identified a particular user\n\n who had received the image of the six-year-old. A subsequent search warrant for that\n\n account showed it was associated with Mr. Kroeker, who resided in Dighton, Kansas.\n\n       Chat records from Mr. Kroeker\u2019s account also showed it had been used to\n\n communicate with various individuals who self-identified as minors, and to whom child\n\n pornography was then sent. In some of the chats, Mr. Kroeker described having been\n\n twice suspended for sharing such images. He also encouraged others to move to another\n\n social media platform to more freely exchange child pornography images.\n\n       In December 2020, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation obtained an arrest warrant\n\n and interviewed Mr. Kroeker. He admitted to using Tumblr, and having engaged in chats\n\n with minors until his account was locked. He also admitted to searching for child\n\n pornography. Following these admissions, the KBI obtained a search warrant for\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s residence and devices. The search yielded 25 electronic devices and\n\n electronic storage devices, many of which contained child pornography.\n\n       The State initially arrested Mr. Kroeker in December 2020 and released him on a\n\n surety bond with conditions. Those conditions included Mr. Kroeker\u2019s weekly\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092     Document: 010110707475          Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 3\n\n\n\n appearance at the county courthouse, but they did not include searches at Mr. Kroeker\u2019s\n\n residence or monitoring of his devices.\n\n        Additional state charges were filed upon the discovery of additional evidence of\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s illegal activities, and finally the matter was referred to the United States\n\n Attorney\u2019s Office. On March 22, 2022, a grand jury indicted Mr. Kroeker for receipt of\n\n child pornography relating to the image of the six-year-old, and for possession of child\n\n pornography relating to the images found on his devices in December 2020.\n\n        The government moved for detention pending trial, arguing Mr. Kroeker was a\n\n danger to the community and a flight risk. A magistrate judge held a hearing and ordered\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s release pending trial under various conditions, including a 7 p.m. curfew,\n\n location monitoring, and no unsupervised contact with minors. The government then\n\n appealed to the district court, which held a hearing and issued an order overturning the\n\n magistrate judge\u2019s order. The district court concluded that \u201c[t]he government has carried\n\n its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that there is no combination of\n\n conditions that would reasonably assure the safety of others and the community if\n\n [Mr. Kroeker] were released pending trial.\u201d Aplt. App. at 34-35. This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. Discussion\n\n        The child pornography charges against Mr. Kroeker establish a rebuttable\n\n presumption \u201cthat no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\n\n [his appearance] as required and the safety of the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C.\n\n \u00a7 3142(e)(3)(E). Mr. Kroeker bears the burden of producing evidence to rebut the\n\n presumption. See United States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d 1353, 1354 (10th Cir. 1991)\n\n                                              3\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092     Document: 010110707475         Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 4\n\n\n\n (per curiam). \u201cEven if a defendant\u2019s burden of production is met, the presumption\n\n remains a factor for consideration by the district court in determining whether to release\n\n or detain.\u201d Id. at 1355. At the same time, \u201cthe burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-\n\n flight and danger to the community always remains with the government.\u201d Id. at\n\n 1354-55.\n\n        We review the district court\u2019s ultimate detention decision de novo because it\n\n presents mixed questions of law and fact; however, we review the underlying\n\n findings of fact for clear error. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 613\n\n (10th Cir. 2003). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to\n\n support it, the reviewing court, on review of the entire record, is left with the definite\n\n and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. Gilgert,\n\n 314 F.3d 506, 515 (10th Cir. 2002) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n We review the district court\u2019s findings with significant deference, cognizant that \u201cour\n\n role is not to re-weigh the evidence.\u201d Id. at 515-16.\n\n        We examine four factors in determining whether any release conditions will\n\n reasonably assure Mr. Kroeker\u2019s appearance and the safety of others and the\n\n community: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged . . . ; (2) the\n\n weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the\n\n person . . . ; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the\n\n community that would be posed by the person\u2019s release.\u201d \u00a7 3142(g).\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092     Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022    Page: 5\n\n\n\n       A. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense Charged\n\n       Mr. Kroeker says that in considering this factor, the district court focused on\n\n the ubiquity of internet-accessible devices and the approximately 18 months1 that\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s devices contained child pornography. He argues these circumstances\n\n are common to nearly all child-pornography defendants and that by the district\n\n court\u2019s reasoning, no such defendant would ever be eligible for release. We disagree\n\n with this characterization of the district court\u2019s order, which stated:\n\n       [T]here is evidence that Defendant\u2019s conduct went beyond simply\n       possessing images of child pornography and involved direct\n       communication with the parent of a young child about sexual abuse of\n       that child. The [government\u2019s] proffer indicates Defendant\u2019s\n       communication encouraged the parent to engage in sexual abuse of the\n       child and to share images of that abuse, and that the parent in fact\n       shared an image of the minor with Defendant.\n\n Aplt. App. at 31. Mr. Kroeker does not challenge the accuracy of these factual\n\n findings, which the district court found indicate strongly that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s release\n\n would pose a high risk to the community, and \u201cparticularly to minors who are unable\n\n to protect themselves.\u201d Id. We agree with the district court that these findings\n\n distinguish Mr. Kroeker\u2019s case from those involving only possession of images\n\n downloaded from the internet. Id.2\n\n\n\n       1\n         The district court characterized these 18 months as a \u201csignificant period of\n time [that] indicates an abiding interest in and pursuit of child pornography over a\n lengthy period, and suggests a high propensity to engage in such conduct.\u201d Aplt.\n App. at 32.\n       2\n          Other evidence further supports the district court\u2019s conclusion. For example,\n it appears Mr. Kroeker communicated directly via chat rooms with individuals who\n identified themselves as minors, and that he sent images of child pornography to\n                                             5\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092     Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 6\n\n\n\n        B. Weight of the Evidence\n\n        The district court found that the weight of the evidence against Mr. Kroeker is\n\n \u201cstrong.\u201d Id. at 32 (\u201cThe proffer indicates the government possesses evidence of\n\n electronic records supporting the allegations in the indictment, physical evidence\n\n obtained as a result of search warrants, and admissions by Defendant tending to support\n\n the allegations. The government represents that it has evidence connecting the\n\n communications and images at issue to Defendant and his residence.\u201d). Mr. Kroeker\u2019s\n\n briefing makes no effort to challenge that finding, and we find no fault with it. The\n\n first two factors, then, weigh decidedly against release.\n\n        C. History and Characteristics of the Person\n\n        Section 3142(g) instructs the judicial officer to consider \u201cthe history and\n\n characteristics of the person,\u201d including:\n\n               (A) the person\u2019s character, physical and mental condition, family\n        ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the\n        community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or\n        alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at\n        court proceedings; and\n\n              (B) whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the\n        person was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial,\n        sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under\n        Federal, State, or local law[.]\n\n \u00a7 3142(g)(3)(A)-(B). As the district court noted, Mr. Kroeker is 47 and has no prior\n\n criminal convictions or known criminal history beyond the instant charges. He is an\n\n\n those individuals. Mr. Kroeker also claimed in certain chats that his Tumblr account\n was twice suspended, yet having his account suspended did not discourage him from\n continuing to search for, and share, child pornography.\n                                              6\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092    Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 7\n\n\n\n unemployed truck driver and receives approximately $3,500 a month in\n\n unemployment benefits. He had a stroke in 2020 and has ongoing health issues.\n\n Mr. Kroeker owns a residence in Dighton, Kansas, where he lives by himself. He is\n\n divorced and has no children. He has two siblings in Colorado, one of whom\n\n attended the detention hearing. He also has ties to a local church, but that connection\n\n dates back nine months at most.\n\n       The government asserts that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s history and characteristics make\n\n him a flight risk. In addition to the fact that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s ties to Dighton are\n\n minimal, the government also notes that he speaks Spanish fluently and that his\n\n mother lives in Paraguay, where Mr. Kroeker lived when he was younger. The\n\n government asserts that Mr. Kroeker could walk away from his home in Dighton and\n\n abscond to Paraguay \u201cor elsewhere in the southern hemisphere.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Mem.\n\n Br. at 11. But the government points to no evidence that Mr. Kroeker has been to\n\n Paraguay since he entered the United States approximately 20 years ago. And other\n\n than the fact that he speaks Spanish, the government offers no support for its\n\n speculation that he might flee to some other part of South America.\n\n       For his part, Mr. Kroeker emphasizes that he was on pretrial release in\n\n connection with his state charges and did not violate any of the terms of release. The\n\n government notes, however, that state resources for monitoring defendants on pretrial\n\n release are limited. Mr. Kroeker apparently only had to report to the county\n\n courthouse on a weekly basis, and the State\u2019s monitoring of Mr. Kroeker\u2019s internet\n\n use was non-existent. In addition, the range of potential punishment relating to the\n\n                                            7\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092   Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 8\n\n\n\n state charges was much lower than the potential 20 years Mr. Kroeker faces under the\n\n pending federal charges, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2)\u2014which is a consideration we\n\n have found relevant in other cases. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at 618 (noting that\n\n although defendant had complied with terms of conditional release in Arizona, \u201cshe\n\n reasonably believed she was facing only three to four years in jail, whereas now she\n\n knows that she is facing the prospect of life imprisonment\u201d).\n\n       The district court found that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s history and characteristics\n\n generally weigh in favor of release. We might have weighed this factor differently,\n\n but we cannot reweigh the evidence on clear-error review, see Gilgert, 314 F.3d at\n\n 515-16, and a factfinder\u2019s choice between two permissible views of the evidence\n\n cannot be clearly erroneous, see Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564,\n\n 574 (1985).\n\n       D. Danger to the Community\n\n       The fourth factor requires the judicial officer to assess \u201cthe nature and\n\n seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by\n\n [Mr. Kroeker\u2019s] release.\u201d \u00a7 3142(g)(4). \u201cThe concern about safety is to be given a\n\n broader construction than the mere danger of physical violence. Safety to the\n\n community refers to the danger that the defendant might engage in criminal activity\n\n to the detriment of the community.\u201d United States v. Cook, 880 F.2d 1158, 1161\n\n (10th Cir. 1989) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court\n\n cited evidence that Mr. Kroeker successfully encouraged a third party to engage in\n\n sexual abuse of a minor, and that he has communicated with individuals who\n\n                                            8\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092    Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022    Page: 9\n\n\n\n self-identified with minors and shared child pornography images with them. This\n\n evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the danger Mr. Kroeker poses to\n\n minors \u201cstrongly favors\u201d detention. Aplt. App. at 33.\n\n                                    III. Conclusion\n\n       The district court considered the evidence in light of the relevant statutory\n\n factors and the presumption of detention, and it made the necessary factual findings\n\n to support its pretrial detention order.

Background\n\n       In January 2020, North Dakota law enforcement executed a search warrant at a\n\n residence based on a report from Tumblr, a social networking website, that child sexual\n\n abuse material had been uploaded from that location. In particular, the owner of that\n\n Tumblr account sent an image depicting the sexual exploitation of a six-year-old. North\n\n Dakota law enforcement reviewed the Tumblr account and identified a particular user\n\n who had received the image of the six-year-old. A subsequent search warrant for that\n\n account showed it was associated with Mr. Kroeker, who resided in Dighton, Kansas.\n\n       Chat records from Mr. Kroeker\u2019s account also showed it had been used to\n\n communicate with various individuals who self-identified as minors, and to whom child\n\n pornography was then sent. In some of the chats, Mr. Kroeker described having been\n\n twice suspended for sharing such images. He also encouraged others to move to another\n\n social media platform to more freely exchange child pornography images.\n\n       In December 2020, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation obtained an arrest warrant\n\n and interviewed Mr. Kroeker. He admitted to using Tumblr, and having engaged in chats\n\n with minors until his account was locked. He also admitted to searching for child\n\n pornography. Following these admissions, the KBI obtained a search warrant for\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s residence and devices. The search yielded 25 electronic devices and\n\n electronic storage devices, many of which contained child pornography.\n\n       The State initially arrested Mr. Kroeker in December 2020 and released him on a\n\n surety bond with conditions. Those conditions included Mr. Kroeker\u2019s weekly\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092     Document: 010110707475          Date Filed: 07/08/2022     Page: 3\n\n\n\n appearance at the county courthouse, but they did not include searches at Mr. Kroeker\u2019s\n\n residence or monitoring of his devices.\n\n        Additional state charges were filed upon the discovery of additional evidence of\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s illegal activities, and finally the matter was referred to the United States\n\n Attorney\u2019s Office. On March 22, 2022, a grand jury indicted Mr. Kroeker for receipt of\n\n child pornography relating to the image of the six-year-old, and for possession of child\n\n pornography relating to the images found on his devices in December 2020.\n\n        The government moved for detention pending trial, arguing Mr. Kroeker was a\n\n danger to the community and a flight risk. A magistrate judge held a hearing and ordered\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s release pending trial under various conditions, including a 7 p.m. curfew,\n\n location monitoring, and no unsupervised contact with minors. The government then\n\n appealed to the district court, which held a hearing and issued an order overturning the\n\n magistrate judge\u2019s order. The district court concluded that \u201c[t]he government has carried\n\n its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that there is no combination of\n\n conditions that would reasonably assure the safety of others and the community if\n\n [Mr. Kroeker] were released pending trial.\u201d Aplt. App. at 34-35. This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. Discussion\n\n        The child pornography charges against Mr. Kroeker establish a rebuttable\n\n presumption \u201cthat no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\n\n [his appearance] as required and the safety of the community.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C.\n\n \u00a7 3142</span><pre class=\"inline\">(e)(3)(E).

Nature and Circumstances of the Offense Charged\n\n       Mr. Kroeker says that in considering this factor, the district court focused on\n\n the ubiquity of internet-accessible devices and the approximately 18 months1 that\n\n Mr. Kroeker\u2019s devices contained child pornography. He argues these circumstances\n\n are common to nearly all child-pornography defendants and that by the district\n\n court\u2019s reasoning, no such defendant would ever be eligible for release. We disagree\n\n with this characterization of the district court\u2019s order, which stated:\n\n       [T]here is evidence that Defendant\u2019s conduct went beyond simply\n       possessing images of child pornography and involved direct\n       communication with the parent of a young child about sexual abuse of\n       that child. The [government\u2019s] proffer indicates Defendant\u2019s\n       communication encouraged the parent to engage in sexual abuse of the\n       child and to share images of that abuse, and that the parent in fact\n       shared an image of the minor with Defendant.\n\n Aplt. App. at 31. Mr. Kroeker does not challenge the accuracy of these factual\n\n findings, which the district court found indicate strongly that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s release\n\n would pose a high risk to the community, and \u201cparticularly to minors who are unable\n\n to protect themselves.\u201d Id. We agree with the district court that these findings\n\n distinguish Mr. Kroeker\u2019s case from those involving only possession of images\n\n downloaded from the internet. Id.2\n\n\n\n       1\n         The district court characterized these 18 months as a \u201csignificant period of\n time [that] indicates an abiding interest in and pursuit of child pornography over a\n lengthy period, and suggests a high propensity to engage in such conduct.\u201d Aplt.\n App. at 32.\n       2\n          Other evidence further supports the district court\u2019s conclusion. For example,\n it appears Mr. Kroeker communicated directly via chat rooms with individuals who\n identified themselves as minors, and that he sent images of child pornography to\n                                             5\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092     Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 6\n\n\n\n        B. Weight of the Evidence\n\n        The district court found that the weight of the evidence against Mr. Kroeker is\n\n \u201cstrong.\u201d Id. at 32 (\u201cThe proffer indicates the government possesses evidence of\n\n electronic records supporting the allegations in the indictment, physical evidence\n\n obtained as a result of search warrants, and admissions by Defendant tending to support\n\n the allegations. The government represents that it has evidence connecting the\n\n communications and images at issue to Defendant and his residence.\u201d). Mr. Kroeker\u2019s\n\n briefing makes no effort to challenge that finding, and we find no fault with it. The\n\n first two factors, then, weigh decidedly against release.\n\n        C. History and Characteristics of the Person\n\n        Section 3142(g) instructs the judicial officer to consider \u201cthe history and\n\n characteristics of the person,\u201d including:\n\n               (A) the person\u2019s character, physical and mental condition, family\n        ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the\n        community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or\n        alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at\n        court proceedings; and\n\n              (B) whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the\n        person was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial,\n        sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under\n        Federal, State, or local law[.]\n\n \u00a7 3142(g)(3)(A)-(B). As the district court noted, Mr. Kroeker is 47 and has no prior\n\n criminal convictions or known criminal history beyond the instant charges. He is an\n\n\n those individuals. Mr. Kroeker also claimed in certain chats that his Tumblr account\n was twice suspended, yet having his account suspended did not discourage him from\n continuing to search for, and share, child pornography.\n                                              6\n\fAppellate Case: 22-3092    Document: 010110707475        Date Filed: 07/08/2022      Page: 7\n\n\n\n unemployed truck driver and receives approximately $3,500 a month in\n\n unemployment benefits. He had a stroke in 2020 and has ongoing health issues.\n\n Mr. Kroeker owns a residence in Dighton, Kansas, where he lives by himself. He is\n\n divorced and has no children. He has two siblings in Colorado, one of whom\n\n attended the detention hearing. He also has ties to a local church, but that connection\n\n dates back nine months at most.\n\n       The government asserts that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s history and characteristics make\n\n him a flight risk. In addition to the fact that Mr. Kroeker\u2019s ties to Dighton are\n\n minimal, the government also notes that he speaks Spanish fluently and that his\n\n mother lives in Paraguay, where Mr. Kroeker lived when he was younger. The\n\n government asserts that Mr. Kroeker could walk away from his home in Dighton and\n\n abscond to Paraguay \u201cor elsewhere in the southern hemisphere.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Mem.\n\n Br. at 11. But the government points to no evidence that Mr. Kroeker has been to\n\n Paraguay since he entered the United States approximately 20 years ago. And other\n\n than the fact that he speaks Spanish, the government offers no support for its\n\n speculation that he might flee to some other part of South America.\n\n       For his part, Mr. Kroeker emphasizes that he was on pretrial release in\n\n connection with his state charges and did not violate any of the terms of release. The\n\n government notes, however, that state resources for monitoring defendants on pretrial\n\n release are limited. Mr. Kroeker apparently only had to report to the county\n\n courthouse on a weekly basis, and the State\u2019s monitoring of Mr. Kroeker\u2019s internet\n\n use was non-existent.

(born February 1998), pleaded guilty to three\n\n  counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse (720 ILCS 5/11-1.60(c)(2)(i) (West 2012)) in\n\n  exchange for an agreed sentence of probation. As a result of his guilty plea, respondent was\n\n  required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (730\n\n  ILCS 150/1 et seq. (West 2014)). In April 2021, respondent filed a petition to terminate his sex\n\n  offender registration pursuant to section 3-5(e) of SORA (id. \u00a7 3-5(e)). In September 2021,\n\n  following a hearing, the trial court denied respondent\u2019s petition.\n\n  \u00b63               Respondent appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition to terminate\n\fregistration as a sex offender. Respondent argues that (1) the court abused its discretion by\n\nconsidering non-statutory factors that had no bearing on the issue of respondent\u2019s risk to the\n\ncommunity and (2) the court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We\n\ndisagree and affirm.\n\n\u00b64                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b65                                       A. The Charges\n\n\u00b66             In September 2013, the State filed a juvenile delinquency petition alleging that\n\nrespondent was delinquent in that he had committed one count of aggravated sexual assault (720\n\nILCS 5/11-1.30(b)(i) (West 2012)) and two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse (id.\n\n\u00a7 11-1.60(c)(2)(i)). Count I alleged that respondent, who was under 17 years of age at the time of\n\nthe offenses, had placed his penis the mouth of G.G., who was under 9 years of age, for the\n\npurpose of sexual gratification. Counts II and III alleged that respondent had placed the hands of\n\nE.G. and M.G., who were also under nine years of age, on respondent\u2019s penis for the purpose of\n\nsexual gratification. The petition alleged that the offenses occurred between January and June\n\n2013.\n\n\u00b67                                     B. The Plea Hearing\n\n\u00b68             In May 2015, the parties entered into a partially negotiated plea agreement. The\n\nState amended count I to charge aggravated criminal sexual abuse to G.G. (id.), alleging that\n\nrespondent placed his penis \u201con the face of G.G.\u201d rather than in her mouth. Respondent pleaded\n\nguilty to all three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in exchange for an agreed sentence\n\nof probation. The specific terms of the probation would be determined by the trial court at a\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\u00b69             During the plea hearing, in response to the trial court\u2019s questions, respondent\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fstated that (1) no one had forced or coerced him into pleading guilty, (2) it was his decision alone\n\nto plead guilty, (3) he pleaded guilty to count I as amended and counts II and III, and (4) he\n\nunderstood what was alleged in each of those counts.\n\n\u00b6 10            As part of the factual basis for the plea, the prosecutor stated that between January\n\nand June 2013, respondent was 15 years old. The three victims\u2014G.G., E.G., and M.G.\u2014were all\n\nunder five years old and attended a home daycare run by respondent\u2019s mother. G.G. would\n\ntestify that, while at daycare, respondent placed his penis \u201con her face.\u201d G.G.\u2019s twin sister, E.G.,\n\nwould testify that during the time frame alleged, respondent placed E.G.\u2019s hand on respondent\u2019s\n\npenis. M.G. (who was unrelated to the twins) would testify that respondent also placed M.G.\u2019s\n\nhand on respondent\u2019s penis during that same time period.\n\n\u00b6 11            The trial court found respondent\u2019s plea to be knowing and voluntary and ordered\n\nthe preparation of a \u201cJuvenile Social History\u201d and sex offender evaluation. The court also\n\nadvised respondent that he \u201cwill have a duty *** to register as a sex offender for the rest of your\n\nlife if I accept this plea.\u201d Respondent stated that he understood. The court then advised\n\nrespondent that he \u201cwill have a right to petition the Court after five years. *** [T]here is no\n\nguarantee that [such a] petition will be granted.\u201d Respondent again stated that he understood and\n\nthat he wished to persist in his guilty plea.\n\n\u00b6 12                                 C. The Sentencing Hearing\n\n\u00b6 13                            1. The 2015 Sex Offender Evaluation\n\n\u00b6 14            In August 2015, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. The court first\n\nnoted that it had received a juvenile social history report, to which a sex offender evaluation was\n\nattached. The evaluation was completed by Tom Jenkins of ABC Counseling. Jenkins\n\ninterviewed respondent\u2019s parents for the report. Respondent\u2019s mother (1) denied her son\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fcommitted the offenses against the three children and (2) alleged that M.G.\u2019s mother did not like\n\nrespondent\u2019s mother and had threatened \u201cto get back at\u201d respondent\u2019s family.\n\n\u00b6 15           Jenkins also interviewed respondent, who was 17 at the time of the evaluation.\n\nRespondent denied committing the offenses and stated that his parents, friends, and relatives all\n\nknew he did nothing wrong and that he was only present at the evaluation to satisfy the court.\n\n\u00b6 16           Jenkins used two actuarial instruments to measure respondent\u2019s risk to sexually\n\nreoffend, which scored respondent as \u201clow risk.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 17           In the \u201cSummary and Recommendations\u201d section of the report, Jenkins wrote the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                       \u201cWhile [respondent] has consistently stated he has not engaged in any\n\n               inappropriate sexual behavior, it is this therapist\u2019s belief that [respondent] has\n\n               done the behaviors based on the documents provided for in the completion of the\n\n               assessment. In reviewing the victims\u2019 statements, they are consistent and\n\n               believable. It is rare for children to \u2018make up\u2019 stories like this, let alone three\n\n               victims. Currently, [respondent] does have numerous reasons to deny (he has yet\n\n               to be sentenced, avoidance of further consequences, the support of his parents,\n\n               etc\u2026) the full extent of the sexual behaviors that he has engaged in. It has been\n\n               this evaluator\u2019s experience that even juveniles that have been adjudicated\n\n               [delinquent] deny, minimize and justify their behaviors in the initial stages of\n\n               treatment. Therefore it is not unusual that [respondent] may be in partial denial\n\n               about the true extent of and effect of his sexual behaviors, as it currently appears\n\n               he is. It will be important for [respondent\u2019s] parents to provide an environment\n\n               that is conducive to [respondent\u2019s] disclosure of any and all sexually\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f               inappropriate behaviors that he has engaged in as well as not provide an\n\n               environment that supports opportunities to reoffend.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18           Jenkins recommended, among other things, that respondent engage in counseling\n\non a weekly basis to address issues related to juvenile sexual offending.\n\n\u00b6 19                                2. The Evidence Presented\n\n\u00b6 20           The State submitted five written victim impact statements and one that was\n\npresented orally. Respondent called two acquaintances of respondent who testified that\n\nrespondent was hardworking, affable, caring, dependable, and had a bright future. Respondent\n\nalso submitted a group exhibit of emails attesting to his good character. Respondent then gave a\n\nstatement in allocution. He did not admit or deny committing the offenses but stated he was\n\n\u201csorry for the impact on the families they have felt [sic]\u201d and promised to abide by the terms of\n\nprobation.\n\n\u00b6 21                                      3. The Sentence\n\n\u00b6 22           When fashioning respondent\u2019s sentence, the trial court emphasized respondent\u2019s\n\nand his parents\u2019 denials that respondent committed the offenses. The court noted that respondent\n\nhad \u201cnever said he was sorry for what he\u2019s done\u201d and made the following remarks:\n\n                      \u201cMy order is going to reflect the fact that the parents are in denial and the\n\n               environment in which [respondent] is going to live is going to be one in which his\n\n               denial is facilitated, and that\u2019s a regrettable situation, because what he needs is\n\n               someone who is going to hold him accountable, someone who *** is going to\n\n               confront him with the concept that the first step towards rehabilitation is accepting\n\n               personal responsibility and acknowledging the wrongfulness of one\u2019s conduct, not\n\n               simply saying, I\u2019m sorry you feel so bad, but [rather], I\u2019m sorry for what I did.\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f              There\u2019s a drastic difference between those two statements. It is clear to this Court\n\n              that while [respondent] has pled guilty, the Court accepts the fact that he is very\n\n              much guilty, that that was all a ploy as well to control the damage, and I\n\n              appreciate that that\u2019s a common tactic, but it was a ploy to control the damage\n\n              done to [respondent.] *** The idea that this is made up, when children so young\n\n              from two different homes on separate\u2014two separate occasions can draw pictures\n\n              containing details that children that age wouldn\u2019t know and showing emotion,\n\n              these photos\u2014not photos, these drawings by these children scream about\n\n              emotion. They scream about the victimhood that these young girls encountered at\n\n              the hands of [respondent]. They show erect penis, an erect penis, for instance.\n\n              They show emotion in the sense of anger, and they show joy on the part of\n\n              [respondent] at victimizing them. They show fear. They show disgust. All of that\n\n              is in there. And these little girls are so manipulated by adults as to just make this\n\n              up and able to draw that when given the opportunity? That\u2019s delusional if you\n\n              think that.\n\n                      The Court is, based on [respondent\u2019s] plea alone, but based on all the other\n\n              evidence, absolutely convinced beyond any doubt [respondent] did these things.\n\n              He needs help. *** If he remains in denial and this denial is facilitated and he is\n\n              allowed to exist in this delusional concept that he didn\u2019t do this and that he\u2014this\n\n              is all a frame-up, I mean I got news for you; he\u2019s going to do it again.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 23          The trial court sentenced respondent to a term of probation until he reached the\n\nage of 21. The court emphasized that respondent was to complete \u201call recommended treatment\u201d\n\nwithin two years. The court further ordered respondent\u2019s parents to complete psychosocial\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\feducational classes as recommended in the sex offender evaluation. Last, the court required\n\nrespondent to comply with the requirements of SORA (730 ILCS 150/1 et seq. (West 2014)).\n\n\u00b6 24                  D. The Direct Appeal and Modifications to Probation\n\n\u00b6 25           Respondent appealed, and this court issued an order granting respondent\u2019s motion\n\nfor summary remand, with directions that respondent be given proper admonishments pursuant\n\nto Illinois Supreme Court Rule 605(c) (eff. Oct. 1, 2000), to clarify that respondent must file a\n\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea to comply with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(d) (eff. Dec.\n\n11, 2014).\n\n\u00b6 26           On remand, in February 2016, respondent filed a motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n\nIn March 2016, the trial court resentenced defendant, pursuant to an agreement of the parties, \u201cin\n\naccordance with the prior sentence with modifications.\u201d The new probation order reduced the\n\nterm of probation to 30 months and ended respondent\u2019s home confinement. As part of the\n\nagreement, respondent withdrew his motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n\n\u00b6 27           In April 2018, the State filed a petition to revoke respondent\u2019s probation, alleging\n\nthat respondent committed the offense of leaving the scene of an accident. In August 2018, at a\n\nhearing, the State amended the petition to allege that respondent committed the offense of failure\n\nto reduce speed to avoid an accident. Respondent admitted the amended petition in exchange for\n\nan agreed sentence of probation until his 21st birthday, which was February 12, 2019. All other\n\nconditions of probation remained the same.\n\n\u00b6 28           On February 13, 2019, the trial court entered an order discharging respondent\n\nfrom probation.\n\n\u00b6 29                 E. The Petition To Terminate Sex Offender Registration\n\n\u00b6 30           In April 2021, respondent filed a petition to terminate sex offender registration\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fpursuant to section 3-5(e) of SORA (730 ILCS 150/3-5(e) (West 2020)). Respondent alleged that\n\nhe completed all necessary treatment required by the original sex offender evaluation and had\n\nobtained a new evaluation, which identified him as \u201clow risk to reoffend.\u201d Respondent argued,\n\ntherefore, that he posed no risk to the community. Respondent also argued that the registration\n\nrequirements prevented him from taking extended trips out of state, which affected his ability to\n\ngrow his business.\n\n\u00b6 31           In September 2021 the trial court conducted a hearing on respondent\u2019s petition.\n\n\u00b6 32                                1. Respondent\u2019s Evidence\n\n\u00b6 33                                     a. Jeff Reynolds\n\n\u00b6 34           Jeff Reynolds testified that he was a licensed sex offender treatment provider and\n\nevaluator at Community Resource & Counseling Center (CRCC) with a master\u2019s degree in\n\ncounseling and a Ph.D. in psychology. In early 2021, respondent contacted Reynolds to obtain a\n\nsex offender evaluation. Reynolds prepared a written report of his evaluation, which the trial\n\ncourt admitted into evidence.\n\n\u00b6 35           Reynolds\u2019s report was dated February 2021 and noted that respondent was 23 at\n\nthe time the report was written. Reynolds listed the documents he reviewed for the evaluation:\n\n(1) a written review of the forensic interviews of the three victims prepared by defense expert Dr.\n\nJeffrey Kellogg for use in a hearing pursuant to section 115-10 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/115-10 (West 2014)) that was conducted prior to respondent\u2019s\n\nplea; (2) the adjudicatory order; (3) a polygraph report; (4) a discharge summary from ABC\n\nCounseling; and (5) a \u201csummary of the \u2018Alleged Accusations\u2019 prepared by respondent\u201d in\n\nDecember 2020.\n\n\u00b6 36           Reynolds interviewed respondent as part of the evaluation and wrote that\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\frespondent \u201cwas completely focused on convincing this evaluator that he was not culpable of any\n\nsexually inappropriate behaviors.\u201d Reynolds noted that \u201c[respondent\u2019s] attitude during the\n\ninterview was one of superficial cooperation\u201d and \u201c[respondent] was very focused on impression\n\nmanagement throughout the process.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 37           Reynolds reported that, in the interview, respondent said that the \u201cfalse sex\n\noffense accusations against him make him mad.\u201d Respondent also reported that he\n\n(1) \u201cparticipated in and completed sexual offender treatment at ABC Counseling *** after the\n\noffenses\u201d and (2) \u201cattended treatment sessions for four or five months.\u201d Respondent reported\n\nseeing a therapist as an adult to address stress issues related to having to register as a sexual\n\noffender. Reynolds further wrote that, when asked about the offense, \u201c[respondent] said that\n\nnothing ever happened and reported the entire incident was an act of revenge by the people who\n\naccused him. He said his mother was not going to allow the children to continue at her daycare\n\ncenter and they made up these allegations.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 38           Reynolds also described the instruments he administered on respondent as part of\n\nthe evaluation process. On the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), which measures\n\nthe \u201cextent to which an individual is judged to match the prototypical psychopath,\u201d respondent\n\nscored in the 18th percentile of North American male offenders. Reynolds wrote, \u201cWhile this\n\nscore is not significantly elevated, it is higher than one would expect to see in the general, non-\n\ncriminal population.\u201d Reynolds explained that respondent\u2019s scores on the PCL-R indicated that\n\nhe \u201cis willing and able to use and manipulate others to meet his own needs, but has been able to\n\ndo this in a non-criminal manner or without getting caught.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 39           Reynolds also applied the Multiphasic Sex Inventory-II (MSI-II), which is\n\n\u201cdesigned to identify a client\u2019s attempt to exaggerate or to deny psychopathology.\u201d Reynolds\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fwrote that respondent \u201cwas highly evasive on testing by not responding either true or false to a\n\nlarge number of items that anyone could answer. *** It would appear that he was highly\n\nuncooperative with the testing process.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 40           Next, Reynolds applied three actuarial tools designed to assess risk to sexually\n\nreoffend, the STABLE 2007, ACUTE 2007, and Sexual Violence Risk-20 instrument.\n\nRespondent\u2019s scores on all three tests placed him as a low risk.\n\n\u00b6 41           Reynolds concluded that, \u201cbased on the review of collateral material, the\n\ninterview, and the testing material, [respondent] should be considered a low risk to sexually\n\nreoffend.\u201d In further explanation of his conclusion, Reynolds wrote the following:\n\n                      \u201cDespite his superficial cooperation with the evaluation process, there is\n\n               little to suggest that he is a significant risk to the community. Current research\n\n               indicates that denial of offending behavior is not a factor that elevates risk to\n\n               reoffend. In addition, research suggests that juveniles who offend are statistically\n\n               no more likely to offend as an adult than a juvenile who has not offended. His\n\n               offenses occurred several years ago and there has been no suggestion of sexually\n\n               inappropriate behavior since that time.\n\n                      At this time, there appears to be no reason to suggest that [respondent]\n\n               would benefit from sexual offender treatment. There appears to be no public\n\n               safety issue that would be enhanced by forcing him to continue registering as a\n\n               sexual offender. However, he may benefit from engaging in a course of\n\n               counseling to address the resentment he carries as a result of his past\n\n               experiences.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 42           Reynolds testified consistent with his report. At respondent\u2019s request, the trial\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fcourt also admitted a copy of the ABC Counseling \u201cClosing Summary\u201d that Reynolds relied\n\nupon as part of his evaluation. The ABC Counseling Closing Summary stated that respondent\n\n\u201csuccessfully completed treatment at ABC Counseling & Family Services on 1/27/16. However,\n\nhe did not disclose ever sexually assaulting anyone.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 43           On cross-examination, Reynolds acknowledged that he had not reviewed the\n\npolice reports or watched the forensic interviews of the three victims prior to completing his\n\nwritten report. He testified that he received the police reports \u201cearlier this week.\u201d He stated that\n\nhe proceeded with the interview despite not having the police reports because he felt the\n\npolygraph report and ABC Counseling Closing Report summarized the offenses sufficiently for\n\nhim to proceed. Reynolds did not know whether the polygraph examiner or ABC counselor had\n\nseen the forensic interviews of the victims. Reynolds also testified that he did not review the\n\nvictim impact statements.\n\n\u00b6 44           On redirect examination, Reynolds testified that the information in the police\n\nreports \u201cbasically confirmed the information that was in the reports that I reviewed that\n\n[respondent] committed these offenses against some young girls and that he subsequently pled\n\nguilty.\u201d Accordingly, Reynolds testified the police reports did not affect his conclusion.\n\n\u00b6 45           The trial court asked Reynolds what effect an offender\u2019s denial of committing the\n\noffense \u201crelates to the dealing with triggers and things that *** treatment is supposed to be\n\ndealing with?\u201d Reynolds responded that \u201ctreatment is moving away from triggers and cycles.\u201d\n\nThe court then asked, \u201cIs that the treatment that [respondent] received?\u201d Reynolds answered, \u201cI\n\ndon\u2019t know. That was from ABC. I\u2019m not sure what their approach to that was.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 46                                      b. Sarah Tierney\n\n\u00b6 47           Sarah Tierney testified that she was a licensed clinical professional counselor and\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fhad been counseling respondent off and on over the past six years. Respondent came to her\n\nvoluntarily to address the stress of the legal proceedings against him. She described him as an\n\nempathic and altruistic person and testified that she had no concerns about antisocial personality\n\ndisorder with him.\n\n\u00b6 48           On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Tierney if she had reviewed any\n\npolice reports in connection with respondent\u2019s case. Tierney answered that she saw the\n\npolygraph report and that she remembered seeing \u201csome documents\u201d but could not describe them\n\nor identify them because it was \u201ctoo long ago.\u201d The prosecutor asked Tierney what was the\n\ntrauma that she addressed with respondent in counseling. Tierney answered that she saw in\n\nrespondent symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder that Tierney believed was caused by \u201cthe\n\ncourt experience in general.\u201d Tierney testified that respondent denied committing the offenses\n\nand that Tierney believed him.\n\n\u00b6 49                         c. Dawn Lanning and Cynthia Frontone\n\n\u00b6 50           Dawn Lanning testified that she was a school psychologist and close family friend\n\nof respondent. She testified that respondent had created a business for himself and contributed to\n\nsociety. Lanning testified that she had no safety concerns regarding respondent living in her\n\ncommunity.\n\n\u00b6 51           Cynthia Frontone testified that she was a retired chaplain who counseled prisoners\n\nin the Illinois Department of Corrections. She had known respondent\u2019s family for \u201cmany years.\u201d\n\nFrontone testified that respondent did work for her and was trustworthy. She stated that, as a\n\nmember of the community, she had no safety concerns for respondent. On cross-examination,\n\nshe testified that she did not believe respondent sexually offended on three children.\n\n\u00b6 52                               d. Respondent\u2019s Testimony\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 53           Respondent testified that he was currently 23 years old. In 2015, he started an\n\nonline marketing company that builds and develops websites. He was largely self-taught but\n\ngraduated high school and attended community college for three months. Respondent testified\n\nthat his registration requirements had impaired his ability to grow his business because he could\n\nnot attend out-of-state trade shows or develop out-of-state networking opportunities. Respondent\n\nfurther testified that he had been dating his girlfriend for four years. His registration requirement\n\nprohibited his ability to travel with her to see her family.\n\n\u00b6 54           Respondent testified that his parents, brother, and close friends were a support\n\nsystem for him. He had continued counseling with Tierney to address \u201cstressful situations with\n\nwork or personal life.\u201d When asked why he did not answer some of the questions asked by\n\nReynolds during the evaluation, respondent answered as follows:\n\n               \u201cThe questions that I refused to answer were forced questions. They were\n\n               grotesque and an admission of guilt. I am not here to argue anything. I agree I did\n\n               take a plea deal, that advice by my previous counsel. I to this day still say I admit\n\n               that I have not done this. Feel sorry for anything that has happened, but I know it\n\n               wasn\u2019t me. But I did take that plea deal, so I am just taking the responsibility for\n\n               it.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 55           Last, respondent submitted 15 letters from members of his community attesting to\n\nhis good character.\n\n\u00b6 56                                   2. The State\u2019s Evidence\n\n\u00b6 57           The State called the mother of G.G. and E.G. as a witness. She read a prepared\n\nvictim impact statement. She stated that G.G. and E.G. were now 12 years old and became very\n\nupset when they discovered respondent was petitioning to be removed from the sex offender\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\fregistry. She reminded the court that her girls were \u201csmall children who trusted their baby-\n\nsitter\u2019s son, and he took advantage of that and pleasured himself.\u201d She stated that G.G.\n\nremembers everything and suffers from anxiety attacks. On one occasion, G.G. was admitted to\n\nthe emergency room and had her heart tested to confirm she does not suffer from a heart\n\ncondition but merely anxiety. The mother also said that E.G. asked what could be done to keep\n\nhim on the registry \u201cso that no one else had to go through what they went through as children.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 58           The State next called G.G. as a witness. G.G. first read from a prepared victim\n\nimpact statement. She stated that what respondent did caused her to have anxiety when meeting\n\nnew people. She did not trust anyone, and she slept with a stuffed animal and lights on to feel\n\nsafe. Her anxiety caused her hands to tremble, so she did origami \u201cso my hands can calm down.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 59           The State then asked G.G. whether she recognized respondent, and G.G.\n\nidentified respondent in open court. The State asked G.G., \u201c[D]id [respondent] put his penis in\n\nyour mouth?\u201d G.G. answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The State asked if she remembered it clearly, and G.G.\n\nanswered, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 60           The State also presented a victim impact statement by E.G., which the trial court\n\nadmitted into evidence. In the statement, E.G. wrote that, like her sister, she had anxiety as a\n\nresult of respondent\u2019s actions. She asked the court \u201cto not erase [his] record.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 61           The State also presented a victim impact statement written by M.G.\u2019s\n\ngrandmother. She wrote that she suffered tremendous guilt for trusting respondent\u2019s family to\n\ncare for her four-year-old grandchild. She also lamented that respondent\u2019s actions \u201cdestroyed a\n\ngood friendship\u201d as well as his mother\u2019s daycare business. M.G.\u2019s grandmother described that\n\nrespondent and his parents \u201chave been on a long crusade to *** point the finger at us, which\n\nleads me to the anger I deal with.\u201d She continued, \u201cNot only does [respondent] not accept the\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\fresponsibilities of his actions, but puts the blame back on his 4-year-old victims.\u201d She described\n\nthat she was working as a meter reader, which required her to travel \u201call over this area, including\n\nthe town and neighborhood where [respondent\u2019s family] lives.\u201d She stated that respondent called\n\nher supervisor to claim she was harassing respondent when \u201call I was doing was my job.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 62           Last, the State presented a victim impact letter written by M.G. She wrote that she\n\nhad \u201cnever been able to forget what happened\u201d and that she continued to carry it as a burden. She\n\ncould not tell her friends because she feared they would leave her if they knew what happened to\n\nher. She wrote that her childhood innocence was taken from her and that she did not want to see\n\nit happen again to anyone.\n\n\u00b6 63                                3. The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n\n\u00b6 64           Following the arguments of the parties, the trial court issued an oral ruling\n\ndenying respondent\u2019s petition. The court addressed each of the statutory factors that section\n\n3-5(e) of SORA (730 ILCS 150/3-5(e) (West 2020)) requires a court to consider in determining\n\nwhether respondent posed no risk to the community. First, the court considered the sex offender\n\nevaluation completed by Reynolds. The court noted that the evaluation determined respondent to\n\nbe low risk to reoffend, but the court also found that circumstances existed that diminished the\n\nweight of Reynolds\u2019s evaluation. The court identified those circumstances as Reynolds\u2019s\n\n(1) failure to do a thorough investigation of the facts of this case and (2) reliance on respondent\u2019s\n\ncompletion of treatment at ABC Counseling, even though the ABC treatment did not require\n\nrespondent to \u201cconfront what he pled guilty to.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 65           Regarding respondent\u2019s sex offender history, the trial court found that this factor\n\nweighed against terminating respondent\u2019s registration obligation because (1) respondent\n\noffended against three victims and (2) the victims were all four years old.\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f\u00b6 66           Next, the court considered evidence of respondent\u2019s rehabilitation. The court\n\nacknowledged that respondent presented some positive evidence of rehabilitation, including his\n\nbuilding his own business. The court also noted that members of respondent\u2019s community wrote\n\nletters describing him as hard working and trustworthy. Against this evidence, the court weighed\n\n(1) evidence that respondent violated his probation for fleeing and eluding, a crime of evasion,\n\nand (2) respondent\u2019s consistent denials. The court observed that respondent was \u201cplaying the\n\nvictim card\u201d and alleging that \u201cthe real victims *** are perpetrators of felony offenses against\n\nhim of obstructing justice all for some sort of retaliation or retribution.\u201d The court concluded that\n\nthe denial and playing of the \u201cvictim card\u201d mitigated against finding respondent rehabilitated.\n\n\u00b6 67           After considering respondent\u2019s age at the time of the offense, the trial court found\n\nthat respondent\u2019s age of 15, \u201cas juveniles go,\u201d was \u201ctowards the upper limit.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 68           The court then considered information related to respondent\u2019s mental, physical,\n\neducational and social history. The court observed that respondent (1) sought counseling to deal\n\nwith the stress of coming to court, (2) had friends he was close to, (3) was self-taught, and\n\n(4) was physically fit, all of which reflected positively on respondent.\n\n\u00b6 69           Next, the trial court considered the victim impact statements and found that this\n\nfactor weighed against terminating respondent\u2019s registration. The court distinguished between a\n\n15-year-old offending against a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old offending against 4-year-olds, as\n\nhappened here. The court observed that, under the former scenario, at the time of the hearing to\n\nterminate registration, the offender and victims are \u201cboth adults.\u201d However, the victims in the\n\npresent case were still minors. The court observed that the purpose of registration was to \u201cprotect\n\npeople in their tender years, being their minority years\u201d and gave a \u201cdecent amount of weight to\u201d\n\nthis factor.\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f\u00b6 70            Next, the trial court considered the seventh statutory factor, \u201cother factors deemed\n\nrelevant by the court.\u201d The court noted the \u201cmilitant nature\u201d of respondent\u2019s denials and found\n\nthat, \u201cwhile it\u2019s disturbing and it does go against granting the petition, it\u2019s not a huge controlling\n\nfactor.\u201d The court also noted that respondent \u201cis surrounded by people [who] do not appear to\n\nhold him accountable.\u201d In particular, the court emphasized Reynolds\u2019s statement of respondent\u2019s\n\n\u201cdesire for impression management.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 71            After discussing all of the statutory factors, the court concluded that, \u201c[G]iven all\n\nof this, at this time I think it\u2019s premature, and I cannot find and do not find that [respondent]\n\npresents no risk *** and so I am denying the petition.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 72            This appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 73                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 74            Respondent appeals, arguing that (1) the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nconsidering non-statutory factors that had no bearing on the issue of respondent\u2019s risk to the\n\ncommunity and (2) the court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We\n\ndisagree and affirm.\n\n\u00b6 75                               A. Expedited Appeal Deadline\n\n\u00b6 76            Initially, we note that this case is an accelerated appeal under Illinois Supreme\n\nCourt Rule 660A (eff. July 1, 2018) because it arises from a final judgment in a juvenile\n\ndelinquency proceeding. Rule 660A requires this court to issue its decision within 150 days after\n\nthe filing of the notice of appeal unless there has been \u201cgood cause shown.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 660A(f)\n\n(eff. July 1, 2018).\n\n\u00b6 77            Here, respondent\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on January 4, 2022, and this court\u2019s\n\ndisposition was due to be filed by June 3, 2022. Respondent requested oral argument, which was\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fconducted on June 28, 2022. We also note that respondent is now 24-years old and no longer a\n\njuvenile. Accordingly, given (1) the need to schedule and conduct oral argument and\n\n(2) respondent\u2019s adulthood, we conclude \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for issuing our disposition after the\n\n150-day deadline.\n\n\u00b6 78                     B. The Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 79           Section 3-5 of SORA (730 ILCS 150/3-5 (West 2020)) governs the application of\n\nSORA to juvenile sex offenders and permits a juvenile sex offender who has been adjudicated\n\ndelinquent for an offense which, if committed as an adult would be a felony to petition the trial\n\ncourt to terminate his registration obligation after five years. The court may terminate a sex\n\noffender\u2019s registration obligation if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\noffender poses no risk to the community. Id. \u00a7 3-5(d). To determine whether a sex offender poses\n\na risk to the community, the court shall consider the following factors:\n\n               \u201c(1) a risk assessment performed by an evaluator licensed under the Sex Offender\n\n               Evaluation and Treatment Provider Act;\n\n               (2) the sex offender history of the adjudicated juvenile delinquent;\n\n               (3) evidence of the adjudicated juvenile delinquent\u2019s rehabilitation;\n\n               (4) the age of the adjudicated juvenile delinquent at the time of the offense;\n\n               (5) information related to the adjudicated juvenile delinquent\u2019s mental, physical,\n\n               educational, and social history;\n\n               (6) victim impact statements; and\n\n               (7) any other factors deemed relevant by the court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3-5(e).\n\n\u00b6 80           A trial court\u2019s determination whether a juvenile sex offender has proved by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that he poses no risk to the community is reviewed under the\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\fmanifest weight of the evidence standard. In re T.J.D., 2017 IL App (5th) 170133, \u00b6 29, 90\n\nN.E.3d 1030. \u201cA decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence only where an opposite\n\nconclusion is clearly apparent or where the findings appear to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or not\n\nbased on the evidence presented.\u201d Id. Under this standard, a reviewing court draws all reasonable\n\ninferences in support of the court\u2019s judgment and will reverse the judgment only where the\n\nopposite conclusion is clearly apparent. Id.\n\n\u00b6 81                                        C. This Case\n\n\u00b6 82           1. The Trial Court\u2019s Consideration of \u201cOther Factors Deemed Relevant\u201d\n\n\u00b6 83           Respondent argues that the trial court erred by considering \u201cnon-statutory\u201d factors\n\nthat were not relevant to determining respondent\u2019s risk to the community. Specifically,\n\nrespondent contends that the court abused its discretion by factoring into its decision (1) the fact\n\nthat the victims were still minors, (2) respondent\u2019s denial that he committed the offenses, and\n\n(3) that respondent was \u201csurrounded by people who do not appear to hold him accountable.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 84           Respondent concedes at the outset of his argument that section 3-5(e)(7) permits\n\nthe trial court to consider \u201cany other factors deemed relevant by the court,\u201d and he acknowledges\n\nthat the trial court considered the complained-of factors under this rubric. We note that\n\n(1) section 3-5(e)(7) confers broad discretion upon the trial court to determine what factors it\n\nfinds relevant and (2) respondent provides no authority supporting his argument that the court\u2019s\n\nconsideration of these factors was improper. For this reason alone, respondent\u2019s argument is\n\nunavailing. However, even considering respondent\u2019s arguments on the merits, we conclude the\n\ntrial court\u2019s analysis was proper.\n\n\u00b6 85           a. The Victims\u2019 Ages at the Time of the Hearing on Respondent\u2019s Petition\n\n\u00b6 86           Respondent first argues that the trial court erred by considering that, because the\n\n\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fvictims were still minors at the time of the hearing, respondent\u2019s continued registration served to\n\nprotect them. Respondent contends that while the general intent of SORA is to protect children\n\nfrom sex offenders, the intent of section 3-5 of SORA is to protect the rights of juvenile sex\n\noffenders. Thus, according to respondent, the court should not have considered the protection of\n\nchildren as a factor in its section 3-5 analysis.\n\n\u00b6 87            Respondent\u2019s argument makes little sense. The question at the heart of section 3-5\n\nis what risk, if any, the sex offender poses to the community. Section 3-5 explicitly permits\n\nconsideration of the \u201cvictim impact statements\u201d and \u201cany other factors deemed relevant by the\n\ncourt.\u201d 730 ILCS 150/3-5(e)(6), (7) (West 2020). As the trial court pointed out, the Illinois\n\nSupreme Court in People v. Malchow, 193 Ill. 2d 413, 420, 739 N.E.2d 433, 438 (2000), held\n\nthat \u201cthe legislature\u2019s intent in requiring registration of sex offenders was to create an additional\n\nmeasure of protection from the increasing incidence of sexual assault and child abuse.\u201d Whether\n\nrespondent\u2019s victims are still in the community and whether they are still minors is undoubtedly\n\nrelevant to the risk respondent poses to the community.\n\n\u00b6 88                 b. Respondent\u2019s Denial That He Committed the Offenses\n\n\u00b6 89            Next, respondent argues that the trial court erroneously considered respondent\u2019s\n\ndenial that he committed the offenses because \u201cthe expert testimony presented by Dr. Reynolds\n\nwas that denial of guilt is not a factor in determining an offender\u2019s risk.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 90            The trial court, as trier of fact, was free to determine what weight to give the\n\nevidence and testimony before it, including expert testimony. The court explained why it gave\n\ndiminished weight to Reynolds\u2019s report (see supra \u00b6 64), and the court\u2019s explanation was firmly\n\nsupported by Reynolds\u2019s testimony on cross-examination.\n\n\u00b6 91            In addition, in this case, respondent pleaded guilty to committing the offenses and\n\n\n\n                                                    - 20 -\n\fthen proceeded to deny at every opportunity that he committed the offenses. Respondent\u2019s course\n\nof conduct is different from that of a juvenile who does not plead guilty, is adjudicated\n\ndelinquent, and maintains his innocence at every stage, including trial. In contrast, respondent\u2019s\n\nconduct presents a question of his veracity, which is relevant to a determination of his\n\nrehabilitation and risk to reoffend. This is particularly true in the present case given that\n\nrespondent (1) scored high on the PCL-R, which indicates respondent \u201cis willing and able to use\n\nand manipulate others to meet his own needs\u201d and (2) was \u201chighly evasive\u201d in the MSI-II, which\n\nwas designed to identify an offender\u2019s \u201cattempt to exaggerate or to deny psychopathology.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 92           In short, the trial court was not obligated, as respondent seems to argue, to accept\n\nanything in Reynolds\u2019s report as determinative on the same issue the trial court was called upon\n\nby law to determine: respondent\u2019s risk to the community. Instead, the court properly assessed\n\nrespondent\u2019s denials in the context of the entire case.\n\n\u00b6 93               c. Respondent\u2019s Lack of Accountability From Family and Friends\n\n\u00b6 94           Third, respondent argues that the trial court erred by considering that respondent\n\n\u201cis surrounded by people who do not appear to hold him accountable.\u201d Respondent asserts that\n\n\u201cthis factor is intertwined with the court\u2019s consideration of [respondent\u2019s] continued assertion of\n\ninnocence\u201d and the fact \u201cthat others in [respondent\u2019s] community hold an opinion that he poses\n\nno risk based on their interactions with him should be a factor in favor of granting his petition,\n\nnot denying it.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 95           Again, respondent offers no authority in support of his argument that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by considering this factor. The trial court found this factor relevant to\n\nits analysis, and we agree. The numerous character letters respondent submitted on his behalf\n\ndemonstrate that the members of respondent\u2019s community believe he did not commit the\n\n\n\n                                                - 21 -\n\foffenses to which he pleaded guilty. The author of one letter wrote, \u201cWhen [respondent] was first\n\nconfronted with these charges[,] I knew in my heart they were false and that he had been falsely\n\naccused.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cI strongly believe that [respondent] *** is the true victim of a false\n\naccusation and a fault in our justice system.\u201d And yet another wrote, \u201cAfter hearing about\n\n[respondent\u2019s] charges, I was instantly sick to my stomach that someone really did this to him.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 96           If respondent believes he is the true victim, he is unlikely to change the behaviors\n\nor thought patterns that led to his behaviors. And the community members\u2019 similar belief that\n\nrespondent is innocent suggests that community members will be more likely to give respondent\n\nopportunities to reoffend than they likely would if they recognized the fact that respondent\n\ncommitted sexual offenses against four-year-old children at his mother\u2019s daycare. Accordingly,\n\nrespondent\u2019s residence in a community that does not hold him accountable is relevant to the risk\n\nrespondent poses to that community.\n\n\u00b6 97           For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s consideration of (1) the\n\nvictims\u2019 ages, (2) respondent\u2019s denial that he committed the offenses, and (3) respondent\u2019s being\n\nsurrounded by people who do not hold him accountable was not improper and the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\n\u00b6 98              2. The Trial Court\u2019s Decision Was Supported by the Evidence\n\n\u00b6 99           Respondent also argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s petition was\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Respondent contends that he proved by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that he posed no risk to the community, pointing specifically to\n\n(1) the \u201csignificant\u201d evidence of his rehabilitation and (2) the sex offender evaluation classifying\n\nhim as a low risk to reoffend.\n\n\u00b6 100          Respondent relies primarily on In re B.C., 2018 IL App (3d) 170025, \u00b6 1, 99\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\fN.E.3d 142, in which the Third District reversed and remanded a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition\n\nto terminate registration with instructions to grant the petition. Respondent is correct that factual\n\nsimilarities exist between the present case and B.C. However, we agree with the trial court that\n\nB.C. is distinguishable from the present case.\n\n\u00b6 101          In B.C., the petitioner was 14 years old when he committed aggravated criminal\n\nsexual abuse (720 ILCS 5/12-16(c)(2)(i) (West 2000)) against two minors who were under 9\n\nyears old. B.C., 2018 IL App (3d) 170025, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 10. In 2016, the petitioner in B.C. filed a\n\npetition to terminate his registration and presented positive evidence of his rehabilitation,\n\nincluding his graduation from high school, attendance at community college, and full-time\n\nemployment. Id. \u00b6 10. The petitioner also presented evidence that he had successfully completed\n\nsex offender treatment and had been evaluated as low risk to reoffend. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n\u00b6 102          Importantly, the trial court in the present case found that the following facts\n\ndistinguished B.C. from respondent\u2019s case. The evaluator in B.C. \u201cexplained that the biggest\n\nfactor in preparing the assessment was determining whether B.C. understood his actions were\n\nwrong and how to prevent the behavior in the future.\u201d Id. \u00b6 15. The evaluator testified that B.C.\n\n\u201chad fully accepted responsibility for his offenses [and] understood his triggers.\u201d Id. \u00b6 17. The\n\nevaluator also testified that B.C.\u2019s sex offender treatment had taken four years and consisted of\n\nthree phases, including (1) learning accountability for deviant behavior, (2) understanding\n\ncognitive errors that led to the offender\u2019s poor choices, and (3) managing and understanding the\n\noffender\u2019s triggers and high-risk areas. Id. \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 103          Unlike in B.C., respondent has (1) never accepted responsibility or accountability\n\nfor his actions, (2) engaged in treatment that accepted as a premise that he never committed a sex\n\noffense, and (3) surrounded himself with people who denied the existence of respondent\u2019s risk\n\n\n\n                                                 - 23 -\n\fareas or triggers.\n\n\u00b6 104           Turning to the trial court\u2019s analysis of the evidence in this case, we conclude that\n\nthe court\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s petition to terminate registration was supported by the\n\nevidence. As to the sex offender evaluation, Reynolds assessed respondent as low risk to\n\nreoffend. However, the trial court explained that it gave diminished weight to Reynolds\u2019s\n\nassessment because he did not fully apprise himself of the underlying facts of the case and he\n\nrelied on respondent\u2019s successful completion of ABC Counseling, which the court found to be\n\ninadequate because it did not require respondent to confront his behaviors. Moreover, the\n\nevaluation established that respondent was (1) willing to lie and manipulate to manage his image,\n\n(2) was superficially cooperative, and (3) was highly evasive. The trial court\u2019s finding that\n\nReynolds\u2019s low risk assessment should be afforded diminished weight is supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n\u00b6 105           Regarding the sex offender history of respondent, he offended against three\n\nvictims who were four years old. The trial court correctly identified this factor as \u201csignificant,\u201d\n\nand we agree that it supported denying respondent\u2019s petition, particularly when weighed against\n\nrespondent\u2019s age of 15 at the time of the offenses. The court correctly noted that respondent was\n\nsignificantly older than his victims and much nearer to adulthood. This is not a case where\n\nrespondent was a young child who perpetrated on his peers.\n\n\u00b6 106           Regarding respondent\u2019s rehabilitation, we acknowledge, as did the trial court, that\n\nrespondent presented some positive evidence of rehabilitation. Namely, respondent finished\n\nschool, started a business, voluntarily engaged in counseling, and developed a reputation in his\n\ncommunity for trustworthiness, all of which are positive steps toward being a productive member\n\nof society. However, the court expressed concerns about the authenticity of respondent\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\frehabilitation, noting, \u201c[I]n the sense of his impression management [respondent] does a good\n\njob in impressing the people he meets.\u201d We agree with the trial court that it is difficult to\n\nascertain whether respondent is truly rehabilitated or whether he merely excels at \u201cimpression\n\nmanagement.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court correctly concluded that respondent\u2019s positive\n\nevidence of rehabilitation is mitigated by the questions about his veracity. In particular,\n\nrespondent\u2019s convincing his parents and community that he is the true victim and that his child\n\n\u201caccusers\u201d and their families are the true offenders is inconsistent with his plea of guilty and the\n\nevidence in this case.\n\n\u00b6 107          Regarding respondent\u2019s mental, physical, educational, and social history, the trial\n\ncourt pointed out that respondent sought counseling to deal with the stress of his court\n\ninvolvement and called it the \u201cmature approach.\u201d The court also noted that respondent had\n\nfriends, was educated, and is physically fit. The court engaged in little discussion of these factors\n\nother than noting them as positive. We agree that these are positive factors, but they do not\n\noutweigh some of the more serious concerns identified by the trial court.\n\n\u00b6 108          Regarding the sixth and seventh statutory factors, the \u201cvictim impact statements\u201d\n\nand \u201cother factors deemed relevant by the court,\u201d we have discussed those in detail supra\n\n(\u00b6\u00b6 82-97) and need not repeat that discussion here. We simply note that we conclude the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s consideration of those factors was proper, and those factors weigh against respondent.\n\n\u00b6 109          The trial court concluded that respondent did not prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he posed no risk to the community. Having reviewed the evidence and the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s analysis, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment denying respondent\u2019s petition to\n\nterminate his sex offender registration was supported by the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 110                                   III.

(born February 1998), pleaded guilty to three\n\n  counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse (720 ILCS 5/11-1.60(c)(2)(i) (West 2012)) in\n\n  exchange for an agreed sentence of probation. As a result of his guilty plea, respondent was\n\n  required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (730\n\n  ILCS 150/1 et seq. (West 2014)). In April 2021, respondent filed a petition to terminate his sex\n\n  offender registration pursuant to section 3-5(e) of SORA (id. \u00a7 3-5(e)). In September 2021,\n\n  following a hearing, the trial court denied respondent\u2019s petition.\n\n  \u00b63               Respondent appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition to terminate\n\fregistration as a sex offender. Respondent argues that (1) the court abused its discretion by\n\nconsidering non-statutory factors that had no bearing on the issue of respondent\u2019s risk to the\n\ncommunity and (2) the court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We\n\ndisagree and affirm.\n\n\u00b64                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b65                                       A. The Charges\n\n\u00b66             In September 2013, the State filed a juvenile delinquency petition alleging that\n\nrespondent was delinquent in that he had committed one count of aggravated sexual assault (720\n\nILCS 5/11-1.30(b)(i) (West 2012)) and two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse (id.\n\n\u00a7 11-1.60(c)(2)(i)). Count I alleged that respondent, who was under 17 years of age at the time of\n\nthe offenses, had placed his penis the mouth of G.G., who was under 9 years of age, for the\n\npurpose of sexual gratification. Counts II and III alleged that respondent had placed the hands of\n\nE.G. and M.G., who were also under nine years of age, on respondent\u2019s penis for the purpose of\n\nsexual gratification. The petition alleged that the offenses occurred between January and June\n\n2013.\n\n\u00b67                                     B. The Plea Hearing\n\n\u00b68             In May 2015, the parties entered into a partially negotiated plea agreement. The\n\nState amended count I to charge aggravated criminal sexual abuse to G.G. (id.), alleging that\n\nrespondent placed his penis \u201con the face of G.G.\u201d rather than in her mouth. Respondent pleaded\n\nguilty to all three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in exchange for an agreed sentence\n\nof probation. The specific terms of the probation would be determined by the trial court at a\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\u00b69             During the plea hearing, in response to the trial court\u2019s questions, respondent\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fstated that (1) no one had forced or coerced him into pleading guilty, (2) it was his decision alone\n\nto plead guilty, (3) he pleaded guilty to count I as amended and counts II and III, and (4) he\n\nunderstood what was alleged in each of those counts.\n\n\u00b6 10            As part of the factual basis for the plea, the prosecutor stated that between January\n\nand June 2013, respondent was 15 years old. The three victims\u2014G.G., E.G., and M.G.\u2014were all\n\nunder five years old and attended a home daycare run by respondent\u2019s mother. G.G. would\n\ntestify that, while at daycare, respondent placed his penis \u201con her face.\u201d G.G.\u2019s twin sister, E.G.,\n\nwould testify that during the time frame alleged, respondent placed E.G.\u2019s hand on respondent\u2019s\n\npenis. M.G. (who was unrelated to the twins) would testify that respondent also placed M.G.\u2019s\n\nhand on respondent\u2019s penis during that same time period.\n\n\u00b6 11            The trial court found respondent\u2019s plea to be knowing and voluntary and ordered\n\nthe preparation of a \u201cJuvenile Social History\u201d and sex offender evaluation. The court also\n\nadvised respondent that he \u201cwill have a duty *** to register as a sex offender for the rest of your\n\nlife if I accept this plea.\u201d Respondent stated that he understood. The court then advised\n\nrespondent that he \u201cwill have a right to petition the Court after five years. *** [T]here is no\n\nguarantee that [such a] petition will be granted.\u201d Respondent again stated that he understood and\n\nthat he wished to persist in his guilty plea.\n\n\u00b6 12                                 C. The Sentencing Hearing\n\n\u00b6 13                            1. The 2015 Sex Offender Evaluation\n\n\u00b6 14            In August 2015, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. The court first\n\nnoted that it had received a juvenile social history report, to which a sex offender evaluation was\n\nattached. The evaluation was completed by Tom Jenkins of ABC Counseling. Jenkins\n\ninterviewed respondent\u2019s parents for the report. Respondent\u2019s mother (1) denied her son\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fcommitted the offenses against the three children and (2) alleged that M.G.\u2019s mother did not like\n\nrespondent\u2019s mother and had threatened \u201cto get back at\u201d respondent\u2019s family.\n\n\u00b6 15           Jenkins also interviewed respondent, who was 17 at the time of the evaluation.\n\nRespondent denied committing the offenses and stated that his parents, friends, and relatives all\n\nknew he did nothing wrong and that he was only present at the evaluation to satisfy the court.\n\n\u00b6 16           Jenkins used two actuarial instruments to measure respondent\u2019s risk to sexually\n\nreoffend, which scored respondent as \u201clow risk.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 17           In the \u201cSummary and Recommendations\u201d section of the report, Jenkins wrote the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                       \u201cWhile [respondent] has consistently stated he has not engaged in any\n\n               inappropriate sexual behavior, it is this therapist\u2019s belief that [respondent] has\n\n               done the behaviors based on the documents provided for in the completion of the\n\n               assessment. In reviewing the victims\u2019 statements, they are consistent and\n\n               believable. It is rare for children to \u2018make up\u2019 stories like this, let alone three\n\n               victims. Currently, [respondent] does have numerous reasons to deny (he has yet\n\n               to be sentenced, avoidance of further consequences, the support of his parents,\n\n               etc\u2026) the full extent of the sexual behaviors that he has engaged in. It has been\n\n               this evaluator\u2019s experience that even juveniles that have been adjudicated\n\n               [delinquent] deny, minimize and justify their behaviors in the initial stages of\n\n               treatment. Therefore it is not unusual that [respondent] may be in partial denial\n\n               about the true extent of and effect of his sexual behaviors, as it currently appears\n\n               he is. It will be important for [respondent\u2019s] parents to provide an environment\n\n               that is conducive to [respondent\u2019s] disclosure of any and all sexually\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f               inappropriate behaviors that he has engaged in as well as not provide an\n\n               environment that supports opportunities to reoffend.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18           Jenkins recommended, among other things, that respondent engage in counseling\n\non a weekly basis to address issues related to juvenile sexual offending.\n\n\u00b6 19                                2. The Evidence Presented\n\n\u00b6 20           The State submitted five written victim impact statements and one that was\n\npresented orally. Respondent called two acquaintances of respondent who testified that\n\nrespondent was hardworking, affable, caring, dependable, and had a bright future. Respondent\n\nalso submitted a group exhibit of emails attesting to his good character. Respondent then gave a\n\nstatement in allocution. He did not admit or deny committing the offenses but stated he was\n\n\u201csorry for the impact on the families they have felt [sic]\u201d and promised to abide by the terms of\n\nprobation.\n\n\u00b6 21                                      3. The Sentence\n\n\u00b6 22           When fashioning respondent\u2019s sentence, the trial court emphasized respondent\u2019s\n\nand his parents\u2019 denials that respondent committed the offenses. The court noted that respondent\n\nhad \u201cnever said he was sorry for what he\u2019s done\u201d and made the following remarks:\n\n                      \u201cMy order is going to reflect the fact that the parents are in denial and the\n\n               environment in which [respondent] is going to live is going to be one in which his\n\n               denial is facilitated, and that\u2019s a regrettable situation, because what he needs is\n\n               someone who is going to hold him accountable, someone who *** is going to\n\n               confront him with the concept that the first step towards rehabilitation is accepting\n\n               personal responsibility and acknowledging the wrongfulness of one\u2019s conduct, not\n\n               simply saying, I\u2019m sorry you feel so bad, but [rather], I\u2019m sorry for what I did.\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f              There\u2019s a drastic difference between those two statements. It is clear to this Court\n\n              that while [respondent] has pled guilty, the Court accepts the fact that he is very\n\n              much guilty, that that was all a ploy as well to control the damage, and I\n\n              appreciate that that\u2019s a common tactic, but it was a ploy to control the damage\n\n              done to [respondent.] *** The idea that this is made up, when children so young\n\n              from two different homes on separate\u2014two separate occasions can draw pictures\n\n              containing details that children that age wouldn\u2019t know and showing emotion,\n\n              these photos\u2014not photos, these drawings by these children scream about\n\n              emotion. They scream about the victimhood that these young girls encountered at\n\n              the hands of [respondent]. They show erect penis, an erect penis, for instance.\n\n              They show emotion in the sense of anger, and they show joy on the part of\n\n              [respondent] at victimizing them. They show fear. They show disgust. All of that\n\n              is in there. And these little girls are so manipulated by adults as to just make this\n\n              up and able to draw that when given the opportunity? That\u2019s delusional if you\n\n              think that.\n\n                      The Court is, based on [respondent\u2019s] plea alone, but based on all the other\n\n              evidence, absolutely convinced beyond any doubt [respondent] did these things.\n\n              He needs help. *** If he remains in denial and this denial is facilitated and he is\n\n              allowed to exist in this delusional concept that he didn\u2019t do this and that he\u2014this\n\n              is all a frame-up, I mean I got news for you; he\u2019s going to do it again.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 23          The trial court sentenced respondent to a term of probation until he reached the\n\nage of 21. The court emphasized that respondent was to complete \u201call recommended treatment\u201d\n\nwithin two years. The court further ordered respondent\u2019s parents to complete psychosocial\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\feducational classes as recommended in the sex offender evaluation. Last, the court required\n\nrespondent to comply with the requirements of SORA (730 ILCS 150/1 et seq. (West 2014)).\n\n\u00b6 24                  D. The Direct Appeal and Modifications to Probation\n\n\u00b6 25           Respondent appealed, and this court issued an order granting respondent\u2019s motion\n\nfor summary remand, with directions that respondent be given proper admonishments pursuant\n\nto Illinois Supreme Court Rule 605(c) (eff. Oct. 1, 2000), to clarify that respondent must file a\n\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea to comply with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(d) (eff. Dec.\n\n11, 2014).\n\n\u00b6 26           On remand, in February 2016, respondent filed a motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n\nIn March 2016, the trial court resentenced defendant, pursuant to an agreement of the parties, \u201cin\n\naccordance with the prior sentence with modifications.\u201d The new probation order reduced the\n\nterm of probation to 30 months and ended respondent\u2019s home confinement. As part of the\n\nagreement, respondent withdrew his motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n\n\u00b6 27           In April 2018, the State filed a petition to revoke respondent\u2019s probation, alleging\n\nthat respondent committed the offense of leaving the scene of an accident. In August 2018, at a\n\nhearing, the State amended the petition to allege that respondent committed the offense of failure\n\nto reduce speed to avoid an accident. Respondent admitted the amended petition in exchange for\n\nan agreed sentence of probation until his 21st birthday, which was February 12, 2019. All other\n\nconditions of probation remained the same.\n\n\u00b6 28           On February 13, 2019, the trial court entered an order discharging respondent\n\nfrom probation.\n\n\u00b6 29                 E. The Petition To Terminate Sex Offender Registration\n\n\u00b6 30           In April 2021, respondent filed a petition to terminate sex offender registration\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fpursuant to section 3-5(e) of SORA (730 ILCS 150/3-5(e) (West 2020)). Respondent alleged that\n\nhe completed all necessary treatment required by the original sex offender evaluation and had\n\nobtained a new evaluation, which identified him as \u201clow risk to reoffend.\u201d Respondent argued,\n\ntherefore, that he posed no risk to the community. Respondent also argued that the registration\n\nrequirements prevented him from taking extended trips out of state, which affected his ability to\n\ngrow his business.\n\n\u00b6 31           In September 2021 the trial court conducted a hearing on respondent\u2019s petition.\n\n\u00b6 32                                1. Respondent\u2019s Evidence\n\n\u00b6 33                                     a. Jeff Reynolds\n\n\u00b6 34           Jeff Reynolds testified that he was a licensed sex offender treatment provider and\n\nevaluator at Community Resource & Counseling Center (CRCC) with a master\u2019s degree in\n\ncounseling and a Ph.D. in psychology. In early 2021, respondent contacted Reynolds to obtain a\n\nsex offender evaluation. Reynolds prepared a written report of his evaluation, which the trial\n\ncourt admitted into evidence.\n\n\u00b6 35           Reynolds\u2019s report was dated February 2021 and noted that respondent was 23 at\n\nthe time the report was written. Reynolds listed the documents he reviewed for the evaluation:\n\n(1) a written review of the forensic interviews of the three victims prepared by defense expert Dr.\n\nJeffrey Kellogg for use in a hearing pursuant to section 115-10 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/115-10 (West 2014)) that was conducted prior to respondent\u2019s\n\nplea; (2) the adjudicatory order; (3) a polygraph report; (4) a discharge summary from ABC\n\nCounseling; and (5) a \u201csummary of the \u2018Alleged Accusations\u2019 prepared by respondent\u201d in\n\nDecember 2020.\n\n\u00b6 36           Reynolds interviewed respondent as part of the evaluation and wrote that\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\frespondent \u201cwas completely focused on convincing this evaluator that he was not culpable of any\n\nsexually inappropriate behaviors.\u201d Reynolds noted that \u201c[respondent\u2019s] attitude during the\n\ninterview was one of superficial cooperation\u201d and \u201c[respondent] was very focused on impression\n\nmanagement throughout the process.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 37           Reynolds reported that, in the interview, respondent said that the \u201cfalse sex\n\noffense accusations against him make him mad.\u201d Respondent also reported that he\n\n(1) \u201cparticipated in and completed sexual offender treatment at ABC Counseling *** after the\n\noffenses\u201d and (2) \u201cattended treatment sessions for four or five months.\u201d Respondent reported\n\nseeing a therapist as an adult to address stress issues related to having to register as a sexual\n\noffender. Reynolds further wrote that, when asked about the offense, \u201c[respondent] said that\n\nnothing ever happened and reported the entire incident was an act of revenge by the people who\n\naccused him. He said his mother was not going to allow the children to continue at her daycare\n\ncenter and they made up these allegations.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 38           Reynolds also described the instruments he administered on respondent as part of\n\nthe evaluation process. On the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), which measures\n\nthe \u201cextent to which an individual is judged to match the prototypical psychopath,\u201d respondent\n\nscored in the 18th percentile of North American male offenders. Reynolds wrote, \u201cWhile this\n\nscore is not significantly elevated, it is higher than one would expect to see in the general, non-\n\ncriminal population.\u201d Reynolds explained that respondent\u2019s scores on the PCL-R indicated that\n\nhe \u201cis willing and able to use and manipulate others to meet his own needs, but has been able to\n\ndo this in a non-criminal manner or without getting caught.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 39           Reynolds also applied the Multiphasic Sex Inventory-II (MSI-II), which is\n\n\u201cdesigned to identify a client\u2019s attempt to exaggerate or to deny psychopathology.\u201d Reynolds\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fwrote that respondent \u201cwas highly evasive on testing by not responding either true or false to a\n\nlarge number of items that anyone could answer. *** It would appear that he was highly\n\nuncooperative with the testing process.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 40           Next, Reynolds applied three actuarial tools designed to assess risk to sexually\n\nreoffend, the STABLE 2007, ACUTE 2007, and Sexual Violence Risk-20 instrument.\n\nRespondent\u2019s scores on all three tests placed him as a low risk.\n\n\u00b6 41           Reynolds concluded that, \u201cbased on the review of collateral material, the\n\ninterview, and the testing material, [respondent] should be considered a low risk to sexually\n\nreoffend.\u201d In further explanation of his conclusion, Reynolds wrote the following:\n\n                      \u201cDespite his superficial cooperation with the evaluation process, there is\n\n               little to suggest that he is a significant risk to the community. Current research\n\n               indicates that denial of offending behavior is not a factor that elevates risk to\n\n               reoffend. In addition, research suggests that juveniles who offend are statistically\n\n               no more likely to offend as an adult than a juvenile who has not offended. His\n\n               offenses occurred several years ago and there has been no suggestion of sexually\n\n               inappropriate behavior since that time.\n\n                      At this time, there appears to be no reason to suggest that [respondent]\n\n               would benefit from sexual offender treatment. There appears to be no public\n\n               safety issue that would be enhanced by forcing him to continue registering as a\n\n               sexual offender. However, he may benefit from engaging in a course of\n\n               counseling to address the resentment he carries as a result of his past\n\n               experiences.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 42           Reynolds testified consistent with his report. At respondent\u2019s request, the trial\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fcourt also admitted a copy of the ABC Counseling \u201cClosing Summary\u201d that Reynolds relied\n\nupon as part of his evaluation. The ABC Counseling Closing Summary stated that respondent\n\n\u201csuccessfully completed treatment at ABC Counseling & Family Services on 1/27/16. However,\n\nhe did not disclose ever sexually assaulting anyone.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 43           On cross-examination, Reynolds acknowledged that he had not reviewed the\n\npolice reports or watched the forensic interviews of the three victims prior to completing his\n\nwritten report. He testified that he received the police reports \u201cearlier this week.\u201d He stated that\n\nhe proceeded with the interview despite not having the police reports because he felt the\n\npolygraph report and ABC Counseling Closing Report summarized the offenses sufficiently for\n\nhim to proceed. Reynolds did not know whether the polygraph examiner or ABC counselor had\n\nseen the forensic interviews of the victims. Reynolds also testified that he did not review the\n\nvictim impact statements.\n\n\u00b6 44           On redirect examination, Reynolds testified that the information in the police\n\nreports \u201cbasically confirmed the information that was in the reports that I reviewed that\n\n[respondent] committed these offenses against some young girls and that he subsequently pled\n\nguilty.\u201d Accordingly, Reynolds testified the police reports did not affect his conclusion.\n\n\u00b6 45           The trial court asked Reynolds what effect an offender\u2019s denial of committing the\n\noffense \u201crelates to the dealing with triggers and things that *** treatment is supposed to be\n\ndealing with?\u201d Reynolds responded that \u201ctreatment is moving away from triggers and cycles.\u201d\n\nThe court then asked, \u201cIs that the treatment that [respondent] received?\u201d Reynolds answered, \u201cI\n\ndon\u2019t know. That was from ABC. I\u2019m not sure what their approach to that was.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 46                                      b. Sarah Tierney\n\n\u00b6 47           Sarah Tierney testified that she was a licensed clinical professional counselor and\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fhad been counseling respondent off and on over the past six years. Respondent came to her\n\nvoluntarily to address the stress of the legal proceedings against him. She described him as an\n\nempathic and altruistic person and testified that she had no concerns about antisocial personality\n\ndisorder with him.\n\n\u00b6 48           On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Tierney if she had reviewed any\n\npolice reports in connection with respondent\u2019s case. Tierney answered that she saw the\n\npolygraph report and that she remembered seeing \u201csome documents\u201d but could not describe them\n\nor identify them because it was \u201ctoo long ago.\u201d The prosecutor asked Tierney what was the\n\ntrauma that she addressed with respondent in counseling. Tierney answered that she saw in\n\nrespondent symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder that Tierney believed was caused by \u201cthe\n\ncourt experience in general.\u201d Tierney testified that respondent denied committing the offenses\n\nand that Tierney believed him.\n\n\u00b6 49                         c. Dawn Lanning and Cynthia Frontone\n\n\u00b6 50           Dawn Lanning testified that she was a school psychologist and close family friend\n\nof respondent. She testified that respondent had created a business for himself and contributed to\n\nsociety. Lanning testified that she had no safety concerns regarding respondent living in her\n\ncommunity.\n\n\u00b6 51           Cynthia Frontone testified that she was a retired chaplain who counseled prisoners\n\nin the Illinois Department of Corrections. She had known respondent\u2019s family for \u201cmany years.\u201d\n\nFrontone testified that respondent did work for her and was trustworthy. She stated that, as a\n\nmember of the community, she had no safety concerns for respondent. On cross-examination,\n\nshe testified that she did not believe respondent sexually offended on three children.\n\n\u00b6 52                               d. Respondent\u2019s Testimony\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 53           Respondent testified that he was currently 23 years old. In 2015, he started an\n\nonline marketing company that builds and develops websites. He was largely self-taught but\n\ngraduated high school and attended community college for three months. Respondent testified\n\nthat his registration requirements had impaired his ability to grow his business because he could\n\nnot attend out-of-state trade shows or develop out-of-state networking opportunities. Respondent\n\nfurther testified that he had been dating his girlfriend for four years. His registration requirement\n\nprohibited his ability to travel with her to see her family.\n\n\u00b6 54           Respondent testified that his parents, brother, and close friends were a support\n\nsystem for him. He had continued counseling with Tierney to address \u201cstressful situations with\n\nwork or personal life.\u201d When asked why he did not answer some of the questions asked by\n\nReynolds during the evaluation, respondent answered as follows:\n\n               \u201cThe questions that I refused to answer were forced questions. They were\n\n               grotesque and an admission of guilt. I am not here to argue anything. I agree I did\n\n               take a plea deal, that advice by my previous counsel. I to this day still say I admit\n\n               that I have not done this. Feel sorry for anything that has happened, but I know it\n\n               wasn\u2019t me. But I did take that plea deal, so I am just taking the responsibility for\n\n               it.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 55           Last, respondent submitted 15 letters from members of his community attesting to\n\nhis good character.\n\n\u00b6 56                                   2. The State\u2019s Evidence\n\n\u00b6 57           The State called the mother of G.G. and E.G. as a witness. She read a prepared\n\nvictim impact statement. She stated that G.G. and E.G. were now 12 years old and became very\n\nupset when they discovered respondent was petitioning to be removed from the sex offender\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\fregistry. She reminded the court that her girls were \u201csmall children who trusted their baby-\n\nsitter\u2019s son, and he took advantage of that and pleasured himself.\u201d She stated that G.G.\n\nremembers everything and suffers from anxiety attacks. On one occasion, G.G. was admitted to\n\nthe emergency room and had her heart tested to confirm she does not suffer from a heart\n\ncondition but merely anxiety. The mother also said that E.G. asked what could be done to keep\n\nhim on the registry \u201cso that no one else had to go through what they went through as children.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 58           The State next called G.G. as a witness. G.G. first read from a prepared victim\n\nimpact statement. She stated that what respondent did caused her to have anxiety when meeting\n\nnew people. She did not trust anyone, and she slept with a stuffed animal and lights on to feel\n\nsafe. Her anxiety caused her hands to tremble, so she did origami \u201cso my hands can calm down.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 59           The State then asked G.G. whether she recognized respondent, and G.G.\n\nidentified respondent in open court. The State asked G.G., \u201c[D]id [respondent] put his penis in\n\nyour mouth?\u201d G.G. answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The State asked if she remembered it clearly, and G.G.\n\nanswered, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 60           The State also presented a victim impact statement by E.G., which the trial court\n\nadmitted into evidence. In the statement, E.G. wrote that, like her sister, she had anxiety as a\n\nresult of respondent\u2019s actions. She asked the court \u201cto not erase [his] record.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 61           The State also presented a victim impact statement written by M.G.\u2019s\n\ngrandmother. She wrote that she suffered tremendous guilt for trusting respondent\u2019s family to\n\ncare for her four-year-old grandchild. She also lamented that respondent\u2019s actions \u201cdestroyed a\n\ngood friendship\u201d as well as his mother\u2019s daycare business. M.G.\u2019s grandmother described that\n\nrespondent and his parents \u201chave been on a long crusade to *** point the finger at us, which\n\nleads me to the anger I deal with.\u201d She continued, \u201cNot only does [respondent] not accept the\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\fresponsibilities of his actions, but puts the blame back on his 4-year-old victims.\u201d She described\n\nthat she was working as a meter reader, which required her to travel \u201call over this area, including\n\nthe town and neighborhood where [respondent\u2019s family] lives.\u201d She stated that respondent called\n\nher supervisor to claim she was harassing respondent when \u201call I was doing was my job.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 62           Last, the State presented a victim impact letter written by M.G. She wrote that she\n\nhad \u201cnever been able to forget what happened\u201d and that she continued to carry it as a burden. She\n\ncould not tell her friends because she feared they would leave her if they knew what happened to\n\nher. She wrote that her childhood innocence was taken from her and that she did not want to see\n\nit happen again to anyone.\n\n\u00b6 63                                3. The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n\n\u00b6 64           Following the arguments of the parties, the trial court issued an oral ruling\n\ndenying respondent\u2019s petition. The court addressed each of the statutory factors that section\n\n3-5(e) of SORA (730 ILCS 150/3-5(e) (West 2020)) requires a court to consider in determining\n\nwhether respondent posed no risk to the community. First, the court considered the sex offender\n\nevaluation completed by Reynolds. The court noted that the evaluation determined respondent to\n\nbe low risk to reoffend, but the court also found that circumstances existed that diminished the\n\nweight of Reynolds\u2019s evaluation. The court identified those circumstances as Reynolds\u2019s\n\n(1) failure to do a thorough investigation of the facts of this case and (2) reliance on respondent\u2019s\n\ncompletion of treatment at ABC Counseling, even though the ABC treatment did not require\n\nrespondent to \u201cconfront what he pled guilty to.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 65           Regarding respondent\u2019s sex offender history, the trial court found that this factor\n\nweighed against terminating respondent\u2019s registration obligation because (1) respondent\n\noffended against three victims and (2) the victims were all four years old.\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f\u00b6 66           Next, the court considered evidence of respondent\u2019s rehabilitation. The court\n\nacknowledged that respondent presented some positive evidence of rehabilitation, including his\n\nbuilding his own business. The court also noted that members of respondent\u2019s community wrote\n\nletters describing him as hard working and trustworthy. Against this evidence, the court weighed\n\n(1) evidence that respondent violated his probation for fleeing and eluding, a crime of evasion,\n\nand (2) respondent\u2019s consistent denials. The court observed that respondent was \u201cplaying the\n\nvictim card\u201d and alleging that \u201cthe real victims *** are perpetrators of felony offenses against\n\nhim of obstructing justice all for some sort of retaliation or retribution.\u201d The court concluded that\n\nthe denial and playing of the \u201cvictim card\u201d mitigated against finding respondent rehabilitated.\n\n\u00b6 67           After considering respondent\u2019s age at the time of the offense, the trial court found\n\nthat respondent\u2019s age of 15, \u201cas juveniles go,\u201d was \u201ctowards the upper limit.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 68           The court then considered information related to respondent\u2019s mental, physical,\n\neducational and social history. The court observed that respondent (1) sought counseling to deal\n\nwith the stress of coming to court, (2) had friends he was close to, (3) was self-taught, and\n\n(4) was physically fit, all of which reflected positively on respondent.\n\n\u00b6 69           Next, the trial court considered the victim impact statements and found that this\n\nfactor weighed against terminating respondent\u2019s registration. The court distinguished between a\n\n15-year-old offending against a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old offending against 4-year-olds, as\n\nhappened here. The court observed that, under the former scenario, at the time of the hearing to\n\nterminate registration, the offender and victims are \u201cboth adults.\u201d However, the victims in the\n\npresent case were still minors. The court observed that the purpose of registration was to \u201cprotect\n\npeople in their tender years, being their minority years\u201d and gave a \u201cdecent amount of weight to\u201d\n\nthis factor.\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f\u00b6 70            Next, the trial court considered the seventh statutory factor, \u201cother factors deemed\n\nrelevant by the court.\u201d The court noted the \u201cmilitant nature\u201d of respondent\u2019s denials and found\n\nthat, \u201cwhile it\u2019s disturbing and it does go against granting the petition, it\u2019s not a huge controlling\n\nfactor.\u201d The court also noted that respondent \u201cis surrounded by people [who] do not appear to\n\nhold him accountable.\u201d In particular, the court emphasized Reynolds\u2019s statement of respondent\u2019s\n\n\u201cdesire for impression management.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 71            After discussing all of the statutory factors, the court concluded that, \u201c[G]iven all\n\nof this, at this time I think it\u2019s premature, and I cannot find and do not find that [respondent]\n\npresents no risk *** and so I am denying the petition.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 72            This appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 73                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 74            Respondent appeals, arguing that (1) the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nconsidering non-statutory factors that had no bearing on the issue of respondent\u2019s risk to the\n\ncommunity and (2) the court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We\n\ndisagree and affirm.\n\n\u00b6 75                               A. Expedited Appeal Deadline\n\n\u00b6 76            Initially, we note that this case is an accelerated appeal under Illinois Supreme\n\nCourt Rule 660A (eff. July 1, 2018) because it arises from a final judgment in a juvenile\n\ndelinquency proceeding. Rule 660A requires this court to issue its decision within 150 days after\n\nthe filing of the notice of appeal unless there has been \u201cgood cause shown.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 660A(f)\n\n(eff. July 1, 2018).\n\n\u00b6 77            Here, respondent\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on January 4, 2022, and this court\u2019s\n\ndisposition was due to be filed by June 3, 2022. Respondent requested oral argument, which was\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fconducted on June 28, 2022. We also note that respondent is now 24-years old and no longer a\n\njuvenile. Accordingly, given (1) the need to schedule and conduct oral argument and\n\n(2) respondent\u2019s adulthood, we conclude \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for issuing our disposition after the\n\n150-day deadline.\n\n\u00b6 78                     B. The Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 79           Section 3-5 of SORA (730 ILCS 150/3-5 (West 2020)) governs the application of\n\nSORA to juvenile sex offenders and permits a juvenile sex offender who has been adjudicated\n\ndelinquent for an offense which, if committed as an adult would be a felony to petition the trial\n\ncourt to terminate his registration obligation after five years.

This Case\n\n\u00b6 82           1. The Trial Court\u2019s Consideration of \u201cOther Factors Deemed Relevant\u201d\n\n\u00b6 83           Respondent argues that the trial court erred by considering \u201cnon-statutory\u201d factors\n\nthat were not relevant to determining respondent\u2019s risk to the community. Specifically,\n\nrespondent contends that the court abused its discretion by factoring into its decision (1) the fact\n\nthat the victims were still minors, (2) respondent\u2019s denial that he committed the offenses, and\n\n(3) that respondent was \u201csurrounded by people who do not appear to hold him accountable.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 84           Respondent concedes at the outset of his argument that section 3-5(e)(7) permits\n\nthe trial court to consider \u201cany other factors deemed relevant by the court,\u201d and he acknowledges\n\nthat the trial court considered the complained-of factors under this rubric. We note that\n\n(1) section 3-5(e)(7) confers broad discretion upon the trial court to determine what factors it\n\nfinds relevant and (2) respondent provides no authority supporting his argument that the court\u2019s\n\nconsideration of these factors was improper. For this reason alone, respondent\u2019s argument is\n\nunavailing. However, even considering respondent\u2019s arguments on the merits, we conclude the\n\ntrial court\u2019s analysis was proper.\n\n\u00b6 85           a. The Victims\u2019 Ages at the Time of the Hearing on Respondent\u2019s Petition\n\n\u00b6 86           Respondent first argues that the trial court erred by considering that, because the\n\n\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fvictims were still minors at the time of the hearing, respondent\u2019s continued registration served to\n\nprotect them. Respondent contends that while the general intent of SORA is to protect children\n\nfrom sex offenders, the intent of section 3-5 of SORA is to protect the rights of juvenile sex\n\noffenders. Thus, according to respondent, the court should not have considered the protection of\n\nchildren as a factor in its section 3-5 analysis.\n\n\u00b6 87            Respondent\u2019s argument makes little sense. The question at the heart of section 3-5\n\nis what risk, if any, the sex offender poses to the community. Section 3-5 explicitly permits\n\nconsideration of the \u201cvictim impact statements\u201d and \u201cany other factors deemed relevant by the\n\ncourt.\u201d 730 ILCS 150/3-5(e)(6), (7) (West 2020). As the trial court pointed out, the Illinois\n\nSupreme Court in People v. Malchow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2180409\"><a href=\"/opinion/2180409/people-v-malchow/\">193 Ill. 2d 413</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2180409\"><a href=\"/opinion/2180409/people-v-malchow/\">739 N.E.2d 433</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438 (2000), held\n\nthat \u201cthe legislature\u2019s intent in requiring registration of sex offenders was to create an additional\n\nmeasure of protection from the increasing incidence of sexual assault and child abuse.\u201d Whether\n\nrespondent\u2019s victims are still in the community and whether they are still minors is undoubtedly\n\nrelevant to the risk respondent poses to the community.\n\n\u00b6 88                 b. Respondent\u2019s Denial That He Committed the Offenses\n\n\u00b6 89            Next, respondent argues that the trial court erroneously considered respondent\u2019s\n\ndenial that he committed the offenses because \u201cthe expert testimony presented by Dr. Reynolds\n\nwas that denial of guilt is not a factor in determining an offender\u2019s risk.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 90            The trial court, as trier of fact, was free to determine what weight to give the\n\nevidence and testimony before it, including expert testimony. The court explained why it gave\n\ndiminished weight to Reynolds\u2019s report (see supra \u00b6 64), and the court\u2019s explanation was firmly\n\nsupported by Reynolds\u2019s testimony on cross-examination.\n\n\u00b6 91            In addition, in this case, respondent pleaded guilty to committing the offenses and\n\n\n\n                                                    - 20 -\n\fthen proceeded to deny at every opportunity that he committed the offenses. Respondent\u2019s course\n\nof conduct is different from that of a juvenile who does not plead guilty, is adjudicated\n\ndelinquent, and maintains his innocence at every stage, including trial. In contrast, respondent\u2019s\n\nconduct presents a question of his veracity, which is relevant to a determination of his\n\nrehabilitation and risk to reoffend. This is particularly true in the present case given that\n\nrespondent (1) scored high on the PCL-R, which indicates respondent \u201cis willing and able to use\n\nand manipulate others to meet his own needs\u201d and (2) was \u201chighly evasive\u201d in the MSI-II, which\n\nwas designed to identify an offender\u2019s \u201cattempt to exaggerate or to deny psychopathology.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 92           In short, the trial court was not obligated, as respondent seems to argue, to accept\n\nanything in Reynolds\u2019s report as determinative on the same issue the trial court was called upon\n\nby law to determine: respondent\u2019s risk to the community. Instead, the court properly assessed\n\nrespondent\u2019s denials in the context of the entire case.\n\n\u00b6 93               c. Respondent\u2019s Lack of Accountability From Family and Friends\n\n\u00b6 94           Third, respondent argues that the trial court erred by considering that respondent\n\n\u201cis surrounded by people who do not appear to hold him accountable.\u201d Respondent asserts that\n\n\u201cthis factor is intertwined with the court\u2019s consideration of [respondent\u2019s] continued assertion of\n\ninnocence\u201d and the fact \u201cthat others in [respondent\u2019s] community hold an opinion that he poses\n\nno risk based on their interactions with him should be a factor in favor of granting his petition,\n\nnot denying it.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 95           Again, respondent offers no authority in support of his argument that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by considering this factor. The trial court found this factor relevant to\n\nits analysis, and we agree. The numerous character letters respondent submitted on his behalf\n\ndemonstrate that the members of respondent\u2019s community believe he did not commit the\n\n\n\n                                                - 21 -\n\foffenses to which he pleaded guilty. The author of one letter wrote, \u201cWhen [respondent] was first\n\nconfronted with these charges[,] I knew in my heart they were false and that he had been falsely\n\naccused.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cI strongly believe that [respondent] *** is the true victim of a false\n\naccusation and a fault in our justice system.\u201d And yet another wrote, \u201cAfter hearing about\n\n[respondent\u2019s] charges, I was instantly sick to my stomach that someone really did this to him.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 96           If respondent believes he is the true victim, he is unlikely to change the behaviors\n\nor thought patterns that led to his behaviors. And the community members\u2019 similar belief that\n\nrespondent is innocent suggests that community members will be more likely to give respondent\n\nopportunities to reoffend than they likely would if they recognized the fact that respondent\n\ncommitted sexual offenses against four-year-old children at his mother\u2019s daycare. Accordingly,\n\nrespondent\u2019s residence in a community that does not hold him accountable is relevant to the risk\n\nrespondent poses to that community.\n\n\u00b6 97           For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s consideration of (1) the\n\nvictims\u2019 ages, (2) respondent\u2019s denial that he committed the offenses, and (3) respondent\u2019s being\n\nsurrounded by people who do not hold him accountable was not improper and the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\n\u00b6 98              2. The Trial Court\u2019s Decision Was Supported by the Evidence\n\n\u00b6 99           Respondent also argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s petition was\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Respondent contends that he proved by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that he posed no risk to the community, pointing specifically to\n\n(1) the \u201csignificant\u201d evidence of his rehabilitation and (2) the sex offender evaluation classifying\n\nhim as a low risk to reoffend.\n\n\u00b6 100          Respondent relies primarily on In re B.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 IL App (3d) 170025</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 1, 99\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\fN.E.3d 142, in which the Third District reversed and remanded a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition\n\nto terminate registration with instructions to grant the petition. Respondent is correct that factual\n\nsimilarities exist between the present case and B.C. However, we agree with the trial court that\n\nB.C. is distinguishable from the present case.\n\n\u00b6 101          In B.C., the petitioner was 14 years old when he committed aggravated criminal\n\nsexual abuse (720 ILCS 5/12-16(c)(2)(i) (West 2000)) against two minors who were under 9\n\nyears old. B.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 IL App (3d) 170025</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 10. In 2016, the petitioner in B.C. filed a\n\npetition to terminate his registration and presented positive evidence of his rehabilitation,\n\nincluding his graduation from high school, attendance at community college, and full-time\n\nemployment. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6 10</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The petitioner also presented evidence that he had successfully completed\n\nsex offender treatment and had been evaluated as low risk to reoffend. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\u00b6 102          Importantly, the trial court in the present case found that the following facts\n\ndistinguished B.C. from respondent\u2019s case. The evaluator in B.C. \u201cexplained that the biggest\n\nfactor in preparing the assessment was determining whether B.C. understood his actions were\n\nwrong and how to prevent the behavior in the future.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6 15</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The evaluator testified that B.C.\n\n\u201chad fully accepted responsibility for his offenses [and] understood his triggers.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6 17</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The\n\nevaluator also testified that B.C.\u2019s sex offender treatment had taken four years and consisted of\n\nthree phases, including (1) learning accountability for deviant behavior, (2) understanding\n\ncognitive errors that led to the offender\u2019s poor choices, and (3) managing and understanding the\n\noffender\u2019s triggers and high-risk areas. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6 14</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\u00b6 103          Unlike in B.C., respondent has (1) never accepted responsibility or accountability\n\nfor his actions, (2) engaged in treatment that accepted as a premise that he never committed a sex\n\noffense, and (3) surrounded himself with people who denied the existence of respondent\u2019s risk\n\n\n\n                                                 - 23 -\n\fareas or triggers.\n\n\u00b6 104           Turning to the trial court\u2019s analysis of the evidence in this case, we conclude that\n\nthe court\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s petition to terminate registration was supported by the\n\nevidence. As to the sex offender evaluation, Reynolds assessed respondent as low risk to\n\nreoffend. However, the trial court explained that it gave diminished weight to Reynolds\u2019s\n\nassessment because he did not fully apprise himself of the underlying facts of the case and he\n\nrelied on respondent\u2019s successful completion of ABC Counseling, which the court found to be\n\ninadequate because it did not require respondent to confront his behaviors. Moreover, the\n\nevaluation established that respondent was (1) willing to lie and manipulate to manage his image,\n\n(2) was superficially cooperative, and (3) was highly evasive. The trial court\u2019s finding that\n\nReynolds\u2019s low risk assessment should be afforded diminished weight is supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n\u00b6 105           Regarding the sex offender history of respondent, he offended against three\n\nvictims who were four years old. The trial court correctly identified this factor as \u201csignificant,\u201d\n\nand we agree that it supported denying respondent\u2019s petition, particularly when weighed against\n\nrespondent\u2019s age of 15 at the time of the offenses. The court correctly noted that respondent was\n\nsignificantly older than his victims and much nearer to adulthood. This is not a case where\n\nrespondent was a young child who perpetrated on his peers.\n\n\u00b6 106           Regarding respondent\u2019s rehabilitation, we acknowledge, as did the trial court, that\n\nrespondent presented some positive evidence of rehabilitation. Namely, respondent finished\n\nschool, started a business, voluntarily engaged in counseling, and developed a reputation in his\n\ncommunity for trustworthiness, all of which are positive steps toward being a productive member\n\nof society. However, the court expressed concerns about the authenticity of respondent\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\frehabilitation, noting, \u201c[I]n the sense of his impression management [respondent] does a good\n\njob in impressing the people he meets.\u201d We agree with the trial court that it is difficult to\n\nascertain whether respondent is truly rehabilitated or whether he merely excels at \u201cimpression\n\nmanagement.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court correctly concluded that respondent\u2019s positive\n\nevidence of rehabilitation is mitigated by the questions about his veracity. In particular,\n\nrespondent\u2019s convincing his parents and community that he is the true victim and that his child\n\n\u201caccusers\u201d and their families are the true offenders is inconsistent with his plea of guilty and the\n\nevidence in this case.\n\n\u00b6 107          Regarding respondent\u2019s mental, physical, educational, and social history, the trial\n\ncourt pointed out that respondent sought counseling to deal with the stress of his court\n\ninvolvement and called it the \u201cmature approach.\u201d The court also noted that respondent had\n\nfriends, was educated, and is physically fit. The court engaged in little discussion of these factors\n\nother than noting them as positive. We agree that these are positive factors, but they do not\n\noutweigh some of the more serious concerns identified by the trial court.\n\n\u00b6 108          Regarding the sixth and seventh statutory factors, the \u201cvictim impact statements\u201d\n\nand \u201cother factors deemed relevant by the court,\u201d we have discussed those in detail supra\n\n(\u00b6\u00b6 82-97) and need not repeat that discussion here. We simply note that we conclude the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s consideration of those factors was proper, and those factors weigh against respondent.\n\n\u00b6 109          The trial court concluded that respondent did not prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he posed no risk to the community. Having reviewed the evidence and the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s analysis, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment denying respondent\u2019s petition to\n\nterminate his sex offender registration was supported by the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 110                                   III.

The defendant argues the trial court should have granted her petition and\n\n                                                  1\n\fordered a new sentencing hearing because no domestic violence evidence was presented at\n\nher sentencing hearing. The defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of her\n\namended petition was improper because, on the petition\u2019s face, it was clear that she was\n\nentitled to relief as a matter of law. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64     Following a bench trial, the defendant was convicted of three counts of predatory\n\ncriminal sexual assault of a child (720 ILCS 5/12-14.1(a)(1) (West 2004)). The defendant\u2019s\n\nnine-year-old daughter, K.K., was the victim. The charging instrument indicated that the\n\noffenses occurred sometime in November 2004 to December 2004. Count I alleged that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s then-husband, James Hargrave (Hargrave), placed his penis in K.K.\u2019s mouth,\n\nand that the defendant aided and abetted Hargrave in the commission of this offense. Count\n\nII alleged the defendant placed her mouth on K.K.\u2019s vagina. Count III alleged that the\n\ndefendant allowed K.K. to place her mouth on the defendant\u2019s vagina. The parties are\n\nfamiliar with the facts elicited at the defendant\u2019s bench trial, which are set forth in greater\n\ndetail in this court\u2019s prior order (People v. Hargrave, 385 Ill. App. 3d 1153 (2007) (table)\n\n(unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23)), and need not be repeated at length\n\nhere. Therefore, only those facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal are repeated.\n\n\u00b65     The State\u2019s evidence at trial showed that the defendant and Hargrave, a former\n\ncorrections officer, engaged in a scheme to get K.K. away from her biological father, James\n\nKukuk (Kukuk). The defendant and Hargrave decided to teach K.K. sexual behavior and\n\nthen make accusations against Kukuk, so that K.K. could accurately describe those acts in\n\na courtroom. According to Hargrave, the scheme began in the \u201clate spring, early summer\n\n                                              2\n\fof 2004.\u201d Hargrave testified that he observed the defendant and K.K. perform oral sex on\n\neach other. He also observed the defendant and K.K. simultaneously use vibrators on\n\nthemselves and each other. Hargrave further testified that the defendant taught K.K. how\n\nto perform oral sex, and that K.K. would perform oral sex on Hargrave. Sometime in\n\nNovember 2004, the defendant and K.K. were both naked in bed with Hargrave and took\n\nturns performing oral sex on him. Hargrave testified that he did not threaten or force the\n\ndefendant to participate in the sexual acts involving K.K.\n\n\u00b66     During the course of this scheme, Hargrave took photographs and videotaped sex\n\nacts between he and K.K. The defendant was not involved in taking the photographs or the\n\nvideotaping. The photographs were taken so that the images could be altered to make it\n\nappear as if Kukuk was the perpetrator and could then be planted in his home or vehicle.\n\nHargrave was not aware of whether photographs of the defendant and K.K. were taken and\n\ntestified that he never saw any photographs of the defendant and K.K. engaged in sexual\n\nactivity.\n\n\u00b67     K.K. testified that Hargrave sexually abused her for many months. K.K. also\n\ntestified that the defendant was sometimes involved in the sexual acts. K.K. did not recall\n\nengaging in sexual acts without Hargrave present. K.K. testified that the defendant and\n\nHargrave told K.K. they had to engage in these activities to set up Kukuk so that he would\n\nleave them alone and go to prison. During her testimony, K.K. indicated that Hargrave was\n\nviolent.\n\n\u00b68     The sexual abuse of K.K. came to light on January 18, 2005, when the defendant\n\ncontacted law enforcement to report that Hargrave had been sexually abusing K.K. The\n\n                                             3\n\fdefendant obtained a key to the safe where Hargrave kept the pictures and videos and\n\nprovided these items to the police. The defendant did not inform the police of her\n\ninvolvement in the sexual acts with K.K. After the police became involved, Hargrave\n\nadvised them of the defendant\u2019s participation in the sexual acts with he and K.K.\n\n\u00b69     The police again interviewed the defendant. In a written statement, the defendant\n\nalleged Hargrave was demanding, violent, and controlling. The defendant claimed that\n\nHargrave had K.K. use a vibrator, and the defendant told K.K. \u201cto just do what she had to\u201d\n\nin order to keep Hargrave from hurting them. The defendant also claimed that Hargrave\n\nhad hit her one time, put a gun to her head, and threatened to shoot the defendant in the\n\nhead. The defendant further alleged Hargrave made her do several sexual things with him\n\nand posted photographs of the defendant on the internet.\n\n\u00b6 10   The police also interviewed K.K. twice regarding the incidents of sexual abuse. In\n\nher first interview, K.K. described the sexual abuse inflicted upon her by Hargrave. In her\n\nsecond interview, K.K. was initially afraid to provide information regarding the\n\ndefendant\u2019s involvement because K.K. was afraid of getting her mother into further trouble.\n\nEventually, K.K. disclosed the defendant\u2019s involvement in the sexual acts. K.K. told the\n\ninvestigator that Hargrave had forced the defendant and threatened physical violence if she\n\ndid not participate. K.K. testified that she lied about Hargrave threatening the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 11   The parties stipulated to the admission of a psychological evaluation report\n\ncompleted by Dr. Fred Klug, a psychologist. The purpose of the report was to determine\n\nwhether the defendant had a mental diagnosis and could protect her daughter from abuse.\n\nDr. Klug\u2019s report noted that the defendant was married multiple times. She claimed her\n\n                                             4\n\fsecond and third husbands were abusive. The defendant reported that after she married\n\nHargrave, her fourth husband, \u201che became highly controlling about nearly everything.\u201d\n\nThe defendant attributed her failure to protect K.K. on her fear of Hargrave. Dr. Klug\n\nconcluded his report by finding the defendant should have neither custody nor visitation\n\nwith K.K.\n\n\u00b6 12   Gary Lemmon, a licensed clinical social worker, conducted a sex offender\n\nevaluation of the defendant. She told Lemmon that she and Hargrave provided sexually\n\nexplicit information to K.K. that progressed to K.K. watching sexual activity between the\n\ndefendant and Hargrave. This eventually led to K.K. engaging in sexual contact with the\n\ndefendant and Hargrave. Lemmon opined that the defendant experienced sexual arousal\n\nand gratification during the sexual acts with K.K. and Hargrave. The defendant told\n\nLemmon that her initial motivation for the plan was for Kukuk to not have custody of K.K.\n\nAs the plan progressed, she claimed that she \u201cdid that because she was intimidated and\n\nfearful\u201d of Hargrave. Lemmon testified that the defendant had stated multiple times that\n\nshe was intimidated by Hargrave and offered several reasons. The defendant stated there\n\nwere several weapons in the household and that Hargrave had put a gun to the defendant\u2019s\n\nhead one time. The defendant alleged that Hargrave claimed to mistreat prisoners where\n\nhe worked and showed the defendant photographs of people who had been killed. The\n\ndefendant further alleged that Hargrave stated that a restraining order would not stop a\n\nbullet and that he would kill the defendant. Hargrave also stated that he could kill his son,\n\nand nobody would find the body.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f\u00b6 13   The defendant testified that she did not agree to engage in the scheme described by\n\nHargrave. According to the defendant, Hargrave approached her in the spring of 2004 with\n\nthe idea to take pictures of K.K. and plant them in Kukuk\u2019s home or vehicle. The defendant\n\ntestified she told Hargrave the idea was \u201cstupid\u201d and did not agree to it. The defendant\n\nclaimed that unbeknownst to her, Hargrave went ahead with the plan on his own. The\n\ndefendant testified that after Thanksgiving in 2004, she learned Hargrave may have been\n\nabusing K.K. The defendant asked K.K. about the abuse, but K.K. initially denied anything\n\nhappened. The defendant stated that in December 2004, K.K. told the defendant what had\n\nhappened, and in January 2005, K.K. informed the defendant that Hargrave had taken\n\nphotographs of her that were stored on a memory card in a safe.\n\n\u00b6 14   The defendant admitted that she and K.K. performed oral sex on Hargrave but\n\nclaimed he had threatened to kill K.K. and the defendant if she did not comply. The\n\ndefendant testified Hargrave was sitting on the bed with a gun when he stated this. The\n\ndefendant denied that she and K.K. performed oral sex on each other and stated they faked\n\nperforming the oral sex. The defendant also denied teaching K.K. how to perform oral sex\n\non a man or woman or how to use a vibrator. The defendant testified that she was compelled\n\nby Hargrave to engage in the sexual acts with K.K. and that she believed, had she not\n\nparticipated, Hargrave would have killed K.K. and the defendant. The defendant testified\n\nthat \u201c[e]verybody in the household had to do what [Hargrave] wanted, when he wanted,\n\nhow he wanted, or you paid and you paid hard.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 15   Dr. Michael Althoff, a specialist in forensic psychology, testified for the defendant.\n\nDr. Althoff was hired to evaluate the defendant to understand her behavior with respect to\n\n                                             6\n\fthe allegations due to the circumstances surrounding her life prior to and during the times\n\nthat the alleged offenses occurred. Dr. Althoff interviewed the defendant, reviewed reports,\n\nand performed psychological tests. He testified that the defendant engaged in dissociative\n\npractices typical of those who have experienced trauma, meaning that the defendant was\n\nunable to experience strong emotions. Dr. Althoff stated that there were indications the\n\ndefendant was also experiencing depression and struggling with intrusive experiences and\n\nrecollections of distressing past events. Dr. Althoff testified that over the course of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s marriage to Hargrave, there was physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Dr.\n\nAlthoff stated that Hargrave subjected the defendant to behaviors such as running to the\n\nmailbox nude, having sex in public places, and placing pictures of the defendant on the\n\ninternet. Dr. Althoff stated this gradually progressed over time and led to Hargrave\u2019s\n\ninvolvement with K.K., eventually culminating in sexual activity involving K.K.\n\n\u00b6 16   Dr. Althoff conducted a series of tests on the defendant. These tests indicated the\n\npresence of depression, anxiety, suspiciousness, distrust, and feelings of victimization. The\n\ndefendant also had a dependent personality and tended to acquiesce and comply to avoid\n\nconflict in situations where pressure or influence was exerted on her. One of the tests,\n\nwhich was designed to look at the nature and extent of psychological maltreatment women\n\nexperience in intimate relationships, indicated a significant degree of isolation, domination,\n\nverbal abuse, and degradation in the defendant\u2019s relationship with Hargrave and her three\n\nprevious husbands.\n\n\u00b6 17   Dr. Althoff diagnosed the defendant with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\n\nchronic in nature and present over the years, and dysthymia, a form of depression that\n\n                                              7\n\fincludes long-term feelings of low self-esteem, subjective distress, and sadness. He also\n\ndiagnosed defendant with dependent personality disorder, which he described as an\n\nenduring pattern of behavior in which she tends to be fearful of being alone, has difficulty\n\nexpressing disagreement, and seeks validation for her self-worth in others. He stated that\n\nthe defendant goes to extensive efforts to obtain nurturance and reassurance from partners,\n\neven to the point of being maltreated. Dr. Althoff noted the defendant had an \u201coverly close\u201d\n\nrelationship with K.K.\n\n\u00b6 18   Dr. Althoff concluded that \u201clooking at what all happened in a progressive collective\n\nkind of way,\u201d the defendant felt she had no other choice but to perform the alleged sexual\n\nacts with K.K. Dr. Althoff explained that individuals who have been subjected to chronic\n\npsychological maltreatment over a course of years have their sense of self eroded, which\n\nhas been termed a \u201cpsychological death.\u201d Dr. Althoff added that he believed the prolonged\n\nvictimization that occurred over the years was a significant factor. He stated the defendant\n\ntold him that she felt she would be killed if she and K.K. did not participate in the sexual\n\nacts. Dr. Althoff opined that the constant fear of something bad happening that may lead\n\nto the death of the defendant or K.K. was a factor that significantly contributed to what\n\noccurred.\n\n\u00b6 19   Dr. Althoff was critical of Dr. Klug\u2019s report. Dr. Althoff testified that it appeared\n\nDr. Klug did not consider \u201cto any significant degree\u201d the physical, psychological, and\n\nsexual abused the defendant endured. Dr. Althoff opined that Dr. Klug\u2019s report suggested\n\nDr. Klug was either dismissive or not attentive to the abuse.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f\u00b6 20   The trial court found the defendant guilty of all three counts of predatory criminal\n\nsexual assault of a child. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that she was\n\ncompelled to engage in the conduct alleged in count I. The trial court found the defendant\n\nhad not shown she acted under a threat of imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm.\n\nAs to counts II and III, the trial court found that K.K. provided credible testimony that the\n\ndefendant performed oral sex on K.K. and allowed her to perform oral sex on the defendant.\n\nThe trial court ordered that a presentence investigation report (PSI) be prepared for\n\nsentencing.\n\n\u00b6 21   In her interview for the PSI, the defendant alleged she and K.K. were forced to\n\nengage in the sexual activity. The defendant indicated that she believed Hargrave had a\n\nloaded gun and would use it. The defendant reported that she never did anything willingly\n\nand had no other choice. The PSI indicated that evaluations by Dr. Klug, Dr. Althoff,\n\nLemmon, and Dr. Seth Hatlelid, who completed a sex offender evaluation and risk\n\nassessment of the defendant, were attached to the PSI and made a part of the report.\n\n\u00b6 22   In Lemmon\u2019s report, which was not admitted at trial, he indicated that despite the\n\ndefendant\u2019s subjective fears of Hargrave, she had the ability and resources to protect K.K.\n\nfrom abuse. Lemmon opined that the defendant would not have initiated any sexual contact\n\nwith K.K. without the influence of another person. Lemmon cited \u201cemotional\n\nenmeshment\u201d between the defendant and K.K. as a possible explanation for the defendant\u2019s\n\ninclusion of K.K. in her \u201cpoor decision-making\u201d and sexual behavior.\n\n\u00b6 23   The defendant met with Dr. Hatlelid because the defendant wanted a second opinion\n\nregarding a sex offender evaluation. Dr. Hatlelid\u2019s report provided that the defendant\n\n                                             9\n\fclaimed she was frightened by Hargrave\u2019s violence and did whatever he asked as a way to\n\nprotect herself and K.K. The defendant alleged Hargrave threatened to take K.K. away if\n\nthe defendant refused. The defendant reported that Hargrave became violent because she\n\nwas not doing enough to get Kukuk out of their lives. The defendant alleged the violence\n\nbecame so severe that she and K.K. would try to keep Hargrave happy all the time. The\n\ndefendant told Dr. Hatlelid that Hargrave sexually abused her and forced her to perform\n\nsexual acts against her will. As an example, the defendant alleged that Hargrave wanted\n\nthe defendant to have intercourse with the family dog, but the defendant refused to do so.\n\nShe did not indicate why she was able to refuse intercourse with the dog but was unwilling\n\nor unable to refuse performing sexual acts with K.K.\n\n\u00b6 24   Dr. Hatlelid opined that although the defendant was capable of protecting K.K., the\n\ndefendant chose not to do so because she feared Hargrave and had a \u201cmisguided and\n\ndependent love for him.\u201d Dr. Hatlelid noted the defendant had no physical or mental\n\ndisabilities that would have prevented her from seeking help, such as obtaining an order of\n\nprotection as she had done in previous relationships. Dr. Hatlelid opined that the defendant\n\nlikely allowed herself to be part of the abuse because she was both dependent on and\n\nterrified of Hargrave leaving her. Dr. Hatlelid indicated that the defendant was\n\nexperiencing severe symptoms of PTSD, which was likely a result of the physical,\n\nemotional, and sexual abuse she suffered from her husbands, particularly Hargrave. Dr.\n\nHatlelid reported that as a result, the defendant operated out of a \u201csurvival mindset\u201d in\n\nwhich she was willing to do whatever it took to survive in her situation at the time. Dr.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fHatlelid believed that the defendant met the criteria for dependent personality disorder and\n\ntolerated egregious abuses because she loved her husband and was afraid to be alone.\n\n\u00b6 25   Dr. Althoff\u2019s report, which was not admitted at trial, detailed the defendant\u2019s\n\nabusive relationships with her prior partners as reported by the defendant. The report noted\n\nthe defendant was exposed to physical and psychological abuse in all four of her past\n\nmarriages and sexual abuse in two of those marriages. The report further noted that it was\n\nsuggested that the defendant\u2019s relationship with Hargrave was the most abusive of all. The\n\nreport concluded that the cumulative effect of the defendant\u2019s personality traits, her overly\n\nclose relationship with K.K., the helplessness the defendant felt due to chronic depression,\n\nthe effects of prolonged victimization, and the fear of great bodily harm or death compelled\n\nthe defendant to compromise her judgment and engage in inappropriate sexual behavior\n\nwith K.K.\n\n\u00b6 26   Also attached to the PSI, among other items, were several letters submitted on behalf\n\nof the defendant. Members of the defendant\u2019s family generally asked for leniency in\n\nsentencing the defendant and indicated Hargrave isolated and intimidated the defendant. A\n\nletter from Diane Wetendorf, an advocate for women battered by law enforcement officers\n\nand consultant on the issue of police-perpetrated domestic violence, asked the trial court to\n\nsentence the defendant to the minimum sentence, urging the trial court to consider the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s actions.\n\n\u00b6 27   At sentencing, the trial court confirmed the parties had received copies of the PSI,\n\naddendums to the PSI, and a lengthy handwritten document authored by the defendant that\n\nthe trial court received and reviewed the day of sentencing. The document was titled\n\n                                             11\n\f\u201cAbuse by James Hargrave to family.\u201d The State then presented its evidence in\n\naggravation. In mitigation, the defendant called Lemmon. He testified that in evaluating\n\nthe defendant, he believed she was a low risk of \u201creoffending sexually.\u201d Lemmon further\n\ntestified that neither this opinion nor any of the opinions he expressed at the time of trial\n\nhad changed.\n\n\u00b6 28   After the parties made sentencing arguments, the defendant made a statement in\n\nallocution. The defendant apologized for the trauma K.K. had endured. The defendant\n\nstated that she realized she could have made other choices although she felt that she had no\n\nother choice at the time and did what she believed she had to so that she and K.K. could\n\nsurvive. The defendant further stated she felt humiliated, helpless, and psychologically\n\nfrozen.\n\n\u00b6 29   In sentencing the defendant, the trial court described the case as disturbing and \u201cone\n\nof the most difficult experiences\u201d the judge had while on the bench. The trial court\n\nindicated that the defendant sought to be treated as a \u201cvictim\u201d or a \u201cbattered woman.\u201d The\n\ntrial court rejected this notion and believed that the defendant was seeking to avoid\n\nresponsibility. The trial court stated that it believed the defendant was as involved in the\n\nscheme to frame Kukuk as Hargrave, if not more so. The trial court suspected that the\n\ndefendant initiated \u201cthis whole horrible project\u201d and engaged in conduct to seduce K.K.\n\ninto engaging in sexual acts with Hargrave and the defendant. The trial court indicated that\n\nit believed the defendant decided to turn in Hargrave because she discovered Hargrave was\n\nengaging in sexual conduct with K.K., without the defendant. The trial court stated, \u201cI think\n\nshe was left out and apparently hurt.\u201d The trial court continued:\n\n                                             12\n\f       \u201cI thought it was interesting to note that Mr. Lemmon concluded, as I\n\ndid, that it does not seem reasonable to believe that she was involved so\n\nextensively over several months in sexual behavior with her daughter present\n\nwithout experiencing sexual arousal and gratification.\n\n       That\u2019s a very disturbing aspect of this case, and I have struggled with\n\ntrying to comprehend it. I do not think that we\u2019re dealing simply with an act\n\nof omission by a weak parent. I think she was a joint perpetrator in this case.\n\n       She claims to have been forced, but that claim I don\u2019t find convincing.\n\nThe husband I would note apparently wanted her to engage in sexual contacts\n\nwith a female and apparently with the family dog. She refused. There were\n\nno particular consequences to that. She was not beaten. She was not\n\nthreatened with a gun. There was nothing to indicate that she did not have\n\nthe ability to refuse. And she certainly had the ability to stop the conduct\n\nbefore it went on for eight months or longer.\n\n       I don\u2019t know how to explain [the defendant\u2019s] conduct in this case.\n\nShe apparently is from a good family. She\u2019s an intelligent woman. There\u2019s\n\nno evidence of mental disability, impairment, or illness that I have seen.\n\nThere is no evidence that she was physically or sexually abused as a child.\n\nShe\u2019s not been shown to have been impaired on drugs or alcohol. She\u2019s a\n\ncompetent person. She\u2019s been a legal secretary. She was an auxiliary\n\npoliceman.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\fThe trial court found the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal history was a factor in mitigation. In\n\naggravation, the trial court further found that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused or threatened\n\nserious permanent injury to K.K. and that a lengthy sentence was necessary to deter others.\n\nThe trial court sentenced the defendant to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on each count to run\n\nconsecutively. The trial court also imposed a fine of $2500 for each count.\n\n\u00b6 30   The defendant appealed her conviction and sentence arguing, among other things,\n\nthat the trial court failed to consider in mitigation that the defendant had a history of abuse\n\nand maltreatment, which resulted in various mental disorders. This court affirmed the\n\ndefendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.\n\n\u00b6 31   The defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief. In her postconviction\n\npetition, the defendant alleged, among other things, that her defense counsel failed to\n\ninvestigate and call expert and lay witnesses that could have offered mitigating evidence\n\nof domestic violence at sentencing. The trial court summarily dismissed the postconviction\n\npetition. The defendant appealed. This court affirmed the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s\n\npostconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 32   The defendant filed a petition for relief from judgment pursuant to section 2-1401(b-\n\n5) of the Civil Code in which she sought a reduction of sentence or a new sentencing\n\nhearing to present mitigating evidence of domestic violence. The defendant failed to\n\nproperly serve her petition upon the State, and the petition was dismissed without prejudice.\n\n\u00b6 33   Next, the defendant filed a second petition for relief from judgment in which she\n\nsought a reduction of sentence or a new sentencing hearing to present mitigating evidence\n\nof mental illness. The defendant subsequently filed a motion to recharacterize her petition\n\n                                              14\n\fas a postconviction petition and a motion for leave to file a successive postconviction\n\npetition. The State filed no responsive pleadings. The trial court held a hearing on the\n\ndefendant\u2019s filings and indicated that it would rule on those pleadings without a written\n\nresponse from the State.\n\n\u00b6 34   Following the hearing, the defendant filed an amended petition for relief from\n\njudgment pursuant to section 2-1401(b-5). In this petition, the defendant alleged that her\n\nparticipation in the offense was related to her mental illness and domestic violence\n\nperpetrated by an intimate partner and that no evidence of domestic violence was presented\n\nat her sentencing hearing. The defendant further alleged that she was unaware of the\n\nmitigating nature of the evidence of mental illness and domestic violence at the time of\n\nsentencing and could not have learned of its significance sooner through diligence. The\n\ndefendant asserted the \u201cnew\u201d evidence of mental illness and domestic violence against her\n\nwas material and noncumulative to other evidence offered at the sentencing hearing, and\n\nwas of such a conclusive character that it would likely change the sentence imposed by the\n\noriginal trial court. The defendant again sought a reduction in sentence or a new sentencing\n\nhearing at which she could present mitigating evidence of mental illness and domestic\n\nviolence.\n\n\u00b6 35   The defendant attached her own affidavit to the petition. The defendant alleged that\n\nshe was diagnosed with PTSD, dysthymia, and dependent personality disorder. The\n\ndefendant further alleged that Hargrave physically, psychologically, and sexually abused\n\nher and that prior to her marriage to Hargrave, she was in three other abusive marriages.\n\nAccording to the defendant, Hargrave threatened to kill her and K.K. if the defendant did\n\n                                            15\n\fnot participate in the sexual abuse of K.K. The defendant averred that Hargrave possessed\n\nseveral firearms at the time and told the defendant how he would dispose of the bodies of\n\nthe defendant and K.K. The defendant indicated that she believed Hargrave\u2019s threats and\n\nfeared for her and K.K.\u2019s lives. The defendant asserted that defense counsel did not present\n\nthis information for the trial court\u2019s consideration at sentencing.\n\n\u00b6 36   The State again filed no responsive pleading. The trial court entered an order\n\ndenying the defendant\u2019s petitions for relief from judgment, including the amended petition,\n\nand the motion to recharacterize her petition. In denying the defendant\u2019s petitions for relief\n\nfrom judgment, the trial court found that the defendant had presented substantial evidence\n\nof domestic abuse, including Dr. Althoff\u2019s opinions. The trial court determined that based\n\non the record from the bench trial and the sentencing hearing, the defendant could not claim\n\nthat evidence of domestic abuse was not before the court at the time of sentencing or that\n\nshe was unaware of the mitigating nature of such evidence at the time. The trial court\n\nconcluded that \u201c[b]ecause such evidence was not only before the court but also formed the\n\ncore of her defense, Defendant cannot meet the requirement of \u00a72-1401(b-5).\u201d This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\u00b6 37                                 II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 38   On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her a new\n\nsentencing hearing pursuant to section 2-1401(b-5) because no domestic violence evidence\n\nwas presented at her sentencing hearing. The defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s\n\ndenial of her amended petition was improper because, on the petition\u2019s face, it was clear\n\nthat she was entitled to relief as a matter of law.\n\n                                              16\n\f\u00b6 39   A proceeding under section 2-1401 provides a statutory mechanism for vacating\n\nfinal judgments in civil or criminal proceedings. People v. Stoecker, 2020 IL 124807, \u00b6 18.\n\nThe purpose of a section 2-1401 petition is to bring facts to the trial court\u2019s attention which,\n\nif known when judgment was entered, would have prevented the entry of the judgment.\n\nPeople v. Haynes, 192 Ill. 2d 437, 463 (2000). A section 2-1401 petition may also be used\n\nto raise a legal challenge to a final judgment or order. Warren County Soil & Water\n\nConservation District v. Walters, 2015 IL 117783, \u00b6 41. It is not designed to provide a\n\ngeneral review of all trial errors, to substitute for a direct appeal, or to obtain relief for\n\nissues previously raised at trial or in other collateral proceedings. People v. Kane, 2013 IL\n\nApp (2d) 110594, \u00b6 13.\n\n\u00b6 40   Proceedings under section 2-1401 are governed by the usual rules of civil practice\n\nand are treated as complaints, inviting responsive pleadings. Stoecker, 2020 IL 124807,\n\n\u00b6 18. The State may answer the petition, move to dismiss it, or choose not to file a\n\nresponsive pleading. Stoecker, 2020 IL 124807, \u00b6 18. As with complaints in civil\n\nproceedings, the State\u2019s failure to respond to a section 2-1401 petition constitutes an\n\nadmission of all well pleaded facts and renders the petition ripe for adjudication on the\n\npleadings alone. People v. Cathey, 2019 IL App (1st) 153118, \u00b6 15. The trial court may\n\ndecide the case on the pleadings, affidavits, exhibits, and supporting material before it,\n\nincluding the record of prior proceedings. People v. Vincent, 226 Ill. 2d 1, 9 (2007). A\n\npetition is properly dismissed where the allegations contained therein are contradicted by\n\nthe record. Cathey, 2019 IL App (1st) 153118, \u00b6 49. When a court enters judgment on the\n\npleadings or dismisses a section 2-1401 petition, we review such order de novo. Vincent,\n\n                                              17\n\f226 Ill. 2d at 18. We may affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on any basis supported by the\n\nrecord. People v. Green, 2012 IL App (4th) 101034, \u00b6 30.\n\n\u00b6 41   In 2016, section 5-5-3.1(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5-5-\n\n3.1(a) (West 2016)) was amended to allow courts to consider evidence of domestic\n\nviolence as a mitigating factor at sentencing. See 730 ILCS 5/5-5-3.1(a)(15) (West 2016).\n\nSection 2-1401 of the Civil Code was also amended to include subsection (b-5), which\n\nallows for relief from judgment based on new evidence of domestic violence. Under section\n\n2-1401(b-5), a petitioner may present a meritorious claim if the petition establishes the\n\nfollowing by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) the petitioner was convicted of a forcible\n\nfelony; (2) the petitioner\u2019s participation in the offense was related to him or her previously\n\nhaving been a victim of domestic violence as perpetrated by an intimate partner; (3) no\n\nevidence of domestic violence against the petitioner was presented at his or her sentencing\n\nhearing; (4) the petitioner was unaware of the mitigating nature of the evidence of the\n\ndomestic violence at the time of sentencing and could not have learned of its significance\n\nsooner through diligence; and (5) the new evidence of domestic violence against the\n\npetitioner is material and noncumulative to other evidence offered at the sentencing\n\nhearing, and is of such a conclusive character that it would likely change the sentence\n\nimposed by the original trial court. 735 ILCS 5/2-1401(b-5) (West 2018). As used in\n\nsubsection (b-5), the term \u201cdomestic violence\u201d means abuse as defined by section 103 of\n\nthe Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986. 735 ILCS 5/2-1401(b-5) (West 2018). Abuse\n\nincludes physical abuse, harassment, interference with personal liberty, or willful\n\ndeprivation. See 750 ILCS 60/103(1) (West 2018).\n\n                                             18\n\f\u00b6 42   Here, the defendant alleged her participation in her offense was related to mental\n\nillness and domestic violence. In her supporting affidavit, the defendant alleged she was\n\ndiagnosed with PTSD, dysthymia, and dependent personality disorder. The defendant\n\nfurther alleged that Hargrave physically, psychologically, and sexually abused her.\n\nAccording to the defendant, Hargrave threatened to kill her and K.K. if the defendant did\n\nnot participate in the sexual abuse of K.K. Hargrave also had several firearms and allegedly\n\ntold the defendant how he was going to dispose of the defendant\u2019s and K.K.\u2019s bodies. The\n\ndefendant indicated that she believed Hargrave\u2019s threats and feared for her and K.K.\u2019s\n\nlives. This was not new evidence of domestic violence nor was it noncumulative to the\n\nother evidence offered at the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing.\n\n\u00b6 43   At trial, the defendant asserted a defense of compulsion as to count I and the trial\n\ncourt heard the testimony of both the defendant and Dr. Althoff. The PSI prepared for\n\nsentencing provided that the defendant claimed she and K.K. were forced to engage in the\n\nsexual activity. The defendant reported that she believed Hargrave had a loaded gun and\n\nwould use it on the defendant and K.K. The defendant claimed that she never did anything\n\nwillingly and had no other choice. Attached to and made part of the PSI were the reports\n\nof Dr. Klug, Dr. Althoff, Dr. Hatlelid, and Lemmon. These reports provided the trial court\n\nwith an account of the defendant\u2019s abusive relationship with Hargrave, and her prior\n\nspouses, as well as opinions as to the defendant\u2019s participation in the offense conduct. Thus,\n\nthe evidence of domestic violence the defendant sought to introduce was contained in the\n\nPSI and its attachments, meaning it was not new or noncumulative to the evidence at\n\nsentencing.\n\n                                             19\n\f\u00b6 44   The defendant claims that the domestic violence evidence was not \u201cpresented\u201d at\n\nher sentencing hearing because defense counsel did not \u201cput on\u201d evidence or argue that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s participation in the offenses was a result of suffering domestic violence from\n\nfour different husbands. The defendant acknowledges, however, that the purported\n\ndomestic violence evidence was a part of the PSI but argues that section 2-1401(b-5)\u2019s\n\npurpose would not be served merely because such evidence was available for the court\u2019s\n\nconsideration even though the record shows that the evidence was \u201cnever actually raised\n\nin court.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 45   At the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court was required to consider the\n\nevidence received at trial and in the PSI. 730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(a)(1), (2) (West 2004). The\n\npurpose of the PSI requirement is to ensure that the trial court will have all necessary\n\ninformation concerning the defendant before imposing a sentence. People v. Harris, 105\n\nIll. 2d 290, 299 (1985). The PSI is to be presented to and considered by the trial court. See\n\n730 ILCS 5/5-3-1 (West 2004). Thus, we find that the evidence of domestic violence was\n\n\u201cpresented\u201d at the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing for purposes of section 2-1401(b-5)(3).\n\n\u00b6 46   Finally, the purported domestic violence evidence was also not of such a conclusive\n\ncharacter that it would have likely changed the sentence imposed by the original trial court.\n\nAs previously stated, the evidence referenced by the defendant in her petition and affidavit\n\nwas not new. Based on the record, the trial court was well aware of the defendant\u2019s claim\n\nthat she was a victim of domestic violence. When sentencing the defendant, the trial court\n\nrejected the notion that the defendant was a \u201cvictim\u201d or a \u201cbattered woman.\u201d Instead, the\n\ntrial court believed the defendant was a joint perpetrator, and was just as involved as\n\n                                             20\n\fHargrave, if not more so, in the development of the scheme to frame Kukuk. Moreover, we\n\npresume the trial court reviewed and considered the PSI. See People v. Sauseda, 2016 IL\n\nApp (1st) 140134, \u00b6 20. After reviewing the record of proceedings at sentencing, we cannot\n\nsay that the trial court failed to review and consider the PSI. Accordingly, the record refutes\n\nthe defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed by the original trial court would likely\n\nhave changed.\n\n\u00b6 47                                III.

The defendant argues the trial court should have granted her petition and\n\n                                                  1\n\fordered a new sentencing hearing because no domestic violence evidence was presented at\n\nher sentencing hearing. The defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of her\n\namended petition was improper because, on the petition\u2019s face, it was clear that she was\n\nentitled to relief as a matter of law. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64     Following a bench trial, the defendant was convicted of three counts of predatory\n\ncriminal sexual assault of a child (720 ILCS 5/12-14.1(a)(1) (West 2004)). The defendant\u2019s\n\nnine-year-old daughter, K.K., was the victim. The charging instrument indicated that the\n\noffenses occurred sometime in November 2004 to December 2004. Count I alleged that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s then-husband, James Hargrave (Hargrave), placed his penis in K.K.\u2019s mouth,\n\nand that the defendant aided and abetted Hargrave in the commission of this offense. Count\n\nII alleged the defendant placed her mouth on K.K.\u2019s vagina. Count III alleged that the\n\ndefendant allowed K.K. to place her mouth on the defendant\u2019s vagina. The parties are\n\nfamiliar with the facts elicited at the defendant\u2019s bench trial, which are set forth in greater\n\ndetail in this court\u2019s prior order (People v. Hargrave, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">385 Ill. App. 3d 1153</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007) (table)\n\n(unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23)), and need not be repeated at length\n\nhere. Therefore, only those facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal are repeated.\n\n\u00b65     The State\u2019s evidence at trial showed that the defendant and Hargrave, a former\n\ncorrections officer, engaged in a scheme to get K.K. away from her biological father, James\n\nKukuk (Kukuk). The defendant and Hargrave decided to teach K.K. sexual behavior and\n\nthen make accusations against Kukuk, so that K.K. could accurately describe those acts in\n\na courtroom. According to Hargrave, the scheme began in the \u201clate spring, early summer\n\n                                              2\n\fof 2004.\u201d Hargrave testified that he observed the defendant and K.K. perform oral sex on\n\neach other. He also observed the defendant and K.K. simultaneously use vibrators on\n\nthemselves and each other. Hargrave further testified that the defendant taught K.K. how\n\nto perform oral sex, and that K.K. would perform oral sex on Hargrave. Sometime in\n\nNovember 2004, the defendant and K.K. were both naked in bed with Hargrave and took\n\nturns performing oral sex on him. Hargrave testified that he did not threaten or force the\n\ndefendant to participate in the sexual acts involving K.K.\n\n\u00b66     During the course of this scheme, Hargrave took photographs and videotaped sex\n\nacts between he and K.K. The defendant was not involved in taking the photographs or the\n\nvideotaping. The photographs were taken so that the images could be altered to make it\n\nappear as if Kukuk was the perpetrator and could then be planted in his home or vehicle.\n\nHargrave was not aware of whether photographs of the defendant and K.K. were taken and\n\ntestified that he never saw any photographs of the defendant and K.K. engaged in sexual\n\nactivity.\n\n\u00b67     K.K. testified that Hargrave sexually abused her for many months. K.K. also\n\ntestified that the defendant was sometimes involved in the sexual acts. K.K. did not recall\n\nengaging in sexual acts without Hargrave present. K.K. testified that the defendant and\n\nHargrave told K.K. they had to engage in these activities to set up Kukuk so that he would\n\nleave them alone and go to prison. During her testimony, K.K. indicated that Hargrave was\n\nviolent.\n\n\u00b68     The sexual abuse of K.K. came to light on January 18, 2005, when the defendant\n\ncontacted law enforcement to report that Hargrave had been sexually abusing K.K. The\n\n                                             3\n\fdefendant obtained a key to the safe where Hargrave kept the pictures and videos and\n\nprovided these items to the police. The defendant did not inform the police of her\n\ninvolvement in the sexual acts with K.K. After the police became involved, Hargrave\n\nadvised them of the defendant\u2019s participation in the sexual acts with he and K.K.\n\n\u00b69     The police again interviewed the defendant. In a written statement, the defendant\n\nalleged Hargrave was demanding, violent, and controlling. The defendant claimed that\n\nHargrave had K.K. use a vibrator, and the defendant told K.K. \u201cto just do what she had to\u201d\n\nin order to keep Hargrave from hurting them. The defendant also claimed that Hargrave\n\nhad hit her one time, put a gun to her head, and threatened to shoot the defendant in the\n\nhead. The defendant further alleged Hargrave made her do several sexual things with him\n\nand posted photographs of the defendant on the internet.\n\n\u00b6 10   The police also interviewed K.K. twice regarding the incidents of sexual abuse. In\n\nher first interview, K.K. described the sexual abuse inflicted upon her by Hargrave. In her\n\nsecond interview, K.K. was initially afraid to provide information regarding the\n\ndefendant\u2019s involvement because K.K. was afraid of getting her mother into further trouble.\n\nEventually, K.K. disclosed the defendant\u2019s involvement in the sexual acts. K.K. told the\n\ninvestigator that Hargrave had forced the defendant and threatened physical violence if she\n\ndid not participate. K.K. testified that she lied about Hargrave threatening the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 11   The parties stipulated to the admission of a psychological evaluation report\n\ncompleted by Dr. Fred Klug, a psychologist. The purpose of the report was to determine\n\nwhether the defendant had a mental diagnosis and could protect her daughter from abuse.\n\nDr. Klug\u2019s report noted that the defendant was married multiple times. She claimed her\n\n                                             4\n\fsecond and third husbands were abusive. The defendant reported that after she married\n\nHargrave, her fourth husband, \u201che became highly controlling about nearly everything.\u201d\n\nThe defendant attributed her failure to protect K.K. on her fear of Hargrave. Dr. Klug\n\nconcluded his report by finding the defendant should have neither custody nor visitation\n\nwith K.K.\n\n\u00b6 12   Gary Lemmon, a licensed clinical social worker, conducted a sex offender\n\nevaluation of the defendant. She told Lemmon that she and Hargrave provided sexually\n\nexplicit information to K.K. that progressed to K.K. watching sexual activity between the\n\ndefendant and Hargrave. This eventually led to K.K. engaging in sexual contact with the\n\ndefendant and Hargrave. Lemmon opined that the defendant experienced sexual arousal\n\nand gratification during the sexual acts with K.K. and Hargrave. The defendant told\n\nLemmon that her initial motivation for the plan was for Kukuk to not have custody of K.K.\n\nAs the plan progressed, she claimed that she \u201cdid that because she was intimidated and\n\nfearful\u201d of Hargrave. Lemmon testified that the defendant had stated multiple times that\n\nshe was intimidated by Hargrave and offered several reasons. The defendant stated there\n\nwere several weapons in the household and that Hargrave had put a gun to the defendant\u2019s\n\nhead one time. The defendant alleged that Hargrave claimed to mistreat prisoners where\n\nhe worked and showed the defendant photographs of people who had been killed. The\n\ndefendant further alleged that Hargrave stated that a restraining order would not stop a\n\nbullet and that he would kill the defendant. Hargrave also stated that he could kill his son,\n\nand nobody would find the body.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f\u00b6 13   The defendant testified that she did not agree to engage in the scheme described by\n\nHargrave. According to the defendant, Hargrave approached her in the spring of 2004 with\n\nthe idea to take pictures of K.K. and plant them in Kukuk\u2019s home or vehicle. The defendant\n\ntestified she told Hargrave the idea was \u201cstupid\u201d and did not agree to it. The defendant\n\nclaimed that unbeknownst to her, Hargrave went ahead with the plan on his own. The\n\ndefendant testified that after Thanksgiving in 2004, she learned Hargrave may have been\n\nabusing K.K. The defendant asked K.K. about the abuse, but K.K. initially denied anything\n\nhappened. The defendant stated that in December 2004, K.K. told the defendant what had\n\nhappened, and in January 2005, K.K. informed the defendant that Hargrave had taken\n\nphotographs of her that were stored on a memory card in a safe.\n\n\u00b6 14   The defendant admitted that she and K.K. performed oral sex on Hargrave but\n\nclaimed he had threatened to kill K.K. and the defendant if she did not comply. The\n\ndefendant testified Hargrave was sitting on the bed with a gun when he stated this. The\n\ndefendant denied that she and K.K. performed oral sex on each other and stated they faked\n\nperforming the oral sex. The defendant also denied teaching K.K. how to perform oral sex\n\non a man or woman or how to use a vibrator. The defendant testified that she was compelled\n\nby Hargrave to engage in the sexual acts with K.K. and that she believed, had she not\n\nparticipated, Hargrave would have killed K.K. and the defendant. The defendant testified\n\nthat \u201c[e]verybody in the household had to do what [Hargrave] wanted, when he wanted,\n\nhow he wanted, or you paid and you paid hard.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 15   Dr. Michael Althoff, a specialist in forensic psychology, testified for the defendant.\n\nDr. Althoff was hired to evaluate the defendant to understand her behavior with respect to\n\n                                             6\n\fthe allegations due to the circumstances surrounding her life prior to and during the times\n\nthat the alleged offenses occurred. Dr. Althoff interviewed the defendant, reviewed reports,\n\nand performed psychological tests. He testified that the defendant engaged in dissociative\n\npractices typical of those who have experienced trauma, meaning that the defendant was\n\nunable to experience strong emotions. Dr. Althoff stated that there were indications the\n\ndefendant was also experiencing depression and struggling with intrusive experiences and\n\nrecollections of distressing past events. Dr. Althoff testified that over the course of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s marriage to Hargrave, there was physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Dr.\n\nAlthoff stated that Hargrave subjected the defendant to behaviors such as running to the\n\nmailbox nude, having sex in public places, and placing pictures of the defendant on the\n\ninternet. Dr. Althoff stated this gradually progressed over time and led to Hargrave\u2019s\n\ninvolvement with K.K., eventually culminating in sexual activity involving K.K.\n\n\u00b6 16   Dr. Althoff conducted a series of tests on the defendant. These tests indicated the\n\npresence of depression, anxiety, suspiciousness, distrust, and feelings of victimization. The\n\ndefendant also had a dependent personality and tended to acquiesce and comply to avoid\n\nconflict in situations where pressure or influence was exerted on her. One of the tests,\n\nwhich was designed to look at the nature and extent of psychological maltreatment women\n\nexperience in intimate relationships, indicated a significant degree of isolation, domination,\n\nverbal abuse, and degradation in the defendant\u2019s relationship with Hargrave and her three\n\nprevious husbands.\n\n\u00b6 17   Dr. Althoff diagnosed the defendant with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\n\nchronic in nature and present over the years, and dysthymia, a form of depression that\n\n                                              7\n\fincludes long-term feelings of low self-esteem, subjective distress, and sadness. He also\n\ndiagnosed defendant with dependent personality disorder, which he described as an\n\nenduring pattern of behavior in which she tends to be fearful of being alone, has difficulty\n\nexpressing disagreement, and seeks validation for her self-worth in others. He stated that\n\nthe defendant goes to extensive efforts to obtain nurturance and reassurance from partners,\n\neven to the point of being maltreated. Dr. Althoff noted the defendant had an \u201coverly close\u201d\n\nrelationship with K.K.\n\n\u00b6 18   Dr. Althoff concluded that \u201clooking at what all happened in a progressive collective\n\nkind of way,\u201d the defendant felt she had no other choice but to perform the alleged sexual\n\nacts with K.K. Dr. Althoff explained that individuals who have been subjected to chronic\n\npsychological maltreatment over a course of years have their sense of self eroded, which\n\nhas been termed a \u201cpsychological death.\u201d Dr. Althoff added that he believed the prolonged\n\nvictimization that occurred over the years was a significant factor. He stated the defendant\n\ntold him that she felt she would be killed if she and K.K. did not participate in the sexual\n\nacts. Dr. Althoff opined that the constant fear of something bad happening that may lead\n\nto the death of the defendant or K.K. was a factor that significantly contributed to what\n\noccurred.\n\n\u00b6 19   Dr. Althoff was critical of Dr. Klug\u2019s report. Dr. Althoff testified that it appeared\n\nDr. Klug did not consider \u201cto any significant degree\u201d the physical, psychological, and\n\nsexual abused the defendant endured. Dr. Althoff opined that Dr. Klug\u2019s report suggested\n\nDr. Klug was either dismissive or not attentive to the abuse.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f\u00b6 20   The trial court found the defendant guilty of all three counts of predatory criminal\n\nsexual assault of a child. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that she was\n\ncompelled to engage in the conduct alleged in count I. The trial court found the defendant\n\nhad not shown she acted under a threat of imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm.\n\nAs to counts II and III, the trial court found that K.K. provided credible testimony that the\n\ndefendant performed oral sex on K.K. and allowed her to perform oral sex on the defendant.\n\nThe trial court ordered that a presentence investigation report (PSI) be prepared for\n\nsentencing.\n\n\u00b6 21   In her interview for the PSI, the defendant alleged she and K.K. were forced to\n\nengage in the sexual activity. The defendant indicated that she believed Hargrave had a\n\nloaded gun and would use it. The defendant reported that she never did anything willingly\n\nand had no other choice. The PSI indicated that evaluations by Dr. Klug, Dr. Althoff,\n\nLemmon, and Dr. Seth Hatlelid, who completed a sex offender evaluation and risk\n\nassessment of the defendant, were attached to the PSI and made a part of the report.\n\n\u00b6 22   In Lemmon\u2019s report, which was not admitted at trial, he indicated that despite the\n\ndefendant\u2019s subjective fears of Hargrave, she had the ability and resources to protect K.K.\n\nfrom abuse. Lemmon opined that the defendant would not have initiated any sexual contact\n\nwith K.K. without the influence of another person. Lemmon cited \u201cemotional\n\nenmeshment\u201d between the defendant and K.K. as a possible explanation for the defendant\u2019s\n\ninclusion of K.K. in her \u201cpoor decision-making\u201d and sexual behavior.\n\n\u00b6 23   The defendant met with Dr. Hatlelid because the defendant wanted a second opinion\n\nregarding a sex offender evaluation. Dr. Hatlelid\u2019s report provided that the defendant\n\n                                             9\n\fclaimed she was frightened by Hargrave\u2019s violence and did whatever he asked as a way to\n\nprotect herself and K.K. The defendant alleged Hargrave threatened to take K.K. away if\n\nthe defendant refused. The defendant reported that Hargrave became violent because she\n\nwas not doing enough to get Kukuk out of their lives. The defendant alleged the violence\n\nbecame so severe that she and K.K. would try to keep Hargrave happy all the time. The\n\ndefendant told Dr. Hatlelid that Hargrave sexually abused her and forced her to perform\n\nsexual acts against her will. As an example, the defendant alleged that Hargrave wanted\n\nthe defendant to have intercourse with the family dog, but the defendant refused to do so.\n\nShe did not indicate why she was able to refuse intercourse with the dog but was unwilling\n\nor unable to refuse performing sexual acts with K.K.\n\n\u00b6 24   Dr. Hatlelid opined that although the defendant was capable of protecting K.K., the\n\ndefendant chose not to do so because she feared Hargrave and had a \u201cmisguided and\n\ndependent love for him.\u201d Dr. Hatlelid noted the defendant had no physical or mental\n\ndisabilities that would have prevented her from seeking help, such as obtaining an order of\n\nprotection as she had done in previous relationships. Dr. Hatlelid opined that the defendant\n\nlikely allowed herself to be part of the abuse because she was both dependent on and\n\nterrified of Hargrave leaving her. Dr. Hatlelid indicated that the defendant was\n\nexperiencing severe symptoms of PTSD, which was likely a result of the physical,\n\nemotional, and sexual abuse she suffered from her husbands, particularly Hargrave. Dr.\n\nHatlelid reported that as a result, the defendant operated out of a \u201csurvival mindset\u201d in\n\nwhich she was willing to do whatever it took to survive in her situation at the time. Dr.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fHatlelid believed that the defendant met the criteria for dependent personality disorder and\n\ntolerated egregious abuses because she loved her husband and was afraid to be alone.\n\n\u00b6 25   Dr. Althoff\u2019s report, which was not admitted at trial, detailed the defendant\u2019s\n\nabusive relationships with her prior partners as reported by the defendant. The report noted\n\nthe defendant was exposed to physical and psychological abuse in all four of her past\n\nmarriages and sexual abuse in two of those marriages. The report further noted that it was\n\nsuggested that the defendant\u2019s relationship with Hargrave was the most abusive of all. The\n\nreport concluded that the cumulative effect of the defendant\u2019s personality traits, her overly\n\nclose relationship with K.K., the helplessness the defendant felt due to chronic depression,\n\nthe effects of prolonged victimization, and the fear of great bodily harm or death compelled\n\nthe defendant to compromise her judgment and engage in inappropriate sexual behavior\n\nwith K.K.\n\n\u00b6 26   Also attached to the PSI, among other items, were several letters submitted on behalf\n\nof the defendant. Members of the defendant\u2019s family generally asked for leniency in\n\nsentencing the defendant and indicated Hargrave isolated and intimidated the defendant. A\n\nletter from Diane Wetendorf, an advocate for women battered by law enforcement officers\n\nand consultant on the issue of police-perpetrated domestic violence, asked the trial court to\n\nsentence the defendant to the minimum sentence, urging the trial court to consider the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s actions.\n\n\u00b6 27   At sentencing, the trial court confirmed the parties had received copies of the PSI,\n\naddendums to the PSI, and a lengthy handwritten document authored by the defendant that\n\nthe trial court received and reviewed the day of sentencing. The document was titled\n\n                                             11\n\f\u201cAbuse by James Hargrave to family.\u201d The State then presented its evidence in\n\naggravation. In mitigation, the defendant called Lemmon. He testified that in evaluating\n\nthe defendant, he believed she was a low risk of \u201creoffending sexually.\u201d Lemmon further\n\ntestified that neither this opinion nor any of the opinions he expressed at the time of trial\n\nhad changed.\n\n\u00b6 28   After the parties made sentencing arguments, the defendant made a statement in\n\nallocution. The defendant apologized for the trauma K.K. had endured. The defendant\n\nstated that she realized she could have made other choices although she felt that she had no\n\nother choice at the time and did what she believed she had to so that she and K.K. could\n\nsurvive. The defendant further stated she felt humiliated, helpless, and psychologically\n\nfrozen.\n\n\u00b6 29   In sentencing the defendant, the trial court described the case as disturbing and \u201cone\n\nof the most difficult experiences\u201d the judge had while on the bench. The trial court\n\nindicated that the defendant sought to be treated as a \u201cvictim\u201d or a \u201cbattered woman.\u201d The\n\ntrial court rejected this notion and believed that the defendant was seeking to avoid\n\nresponsibility. The trial court stated that it believed the defendant was as involved in the\n\nscheme to frame Kukuk as Hargrave, if not more so. The trial court suspected that the\n\ndefendant initiated \u201cthis whole horrible project\u201d and engaged in conduct to seduce K.K.\n\ninto engaging in sexual acts with Hargrave and the defendant. The trial court indicated that\n\nit believed the defendant decided to turn in Hargrave because she discovered Hargrave was\n\nengaging in sexual conduct with K.K., without the defendant. The trial court stated, \u201cI think\n\nshe was left out and apparently hurt.\u201d The trial court continued:\n\n                                             12\n\f       \u201cI thought it was interesting to note that Mr. Lemmon concluded, as I\n\ndid, that it does not seem reasonable to believe that she was involved so\n\nextensively over several months in sexual behavior with her daughter present\n\nwithout experiencing sexual arousal and gratification.\n\n       That\u2019s a very disturbing aspect of this case, and I have struggled with\n\ntrying to comprehend it. I do not think that we\u2019re dealing simply with an act\n\nof omission by a weak parent. I think she was a joint perpetrator in this case.\n\n       She claims to have been forced, but that claim I don\u2019t find convincing.\n\nThe husband I would note apparently wanted her to engage in sexual contacts\n\nwith a female and apparently with the family dog. She refused. There were\n\nno particular consequences to that. She was not beaten. She was not\n\nthreatened with a gun. There was nothing to indicate that she did not have\n\nthe ability to refuse. And she certainly had the ability to stop the conduct\n\nbefore it went on for eight months or longer.\n\n       I don\u2019t know how to explain [the defendant\u2019s] conduct in this case.\n\nShe apparently is from a good family. She\u2019s an intelligent woman. There\u2019s\n\nno evidence of mental disability, impairment, or illness that I have seen.\n\nThere is no evidence that she was physically or sexually abused as a child.\n\nShe\u2019s not been shown to have been impaired on drugs or alcohol. She\u2019s a\n\ncompetent person. She\u2019s been a legal secretary. She was an auxiliary\n\npoliceman.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\fThe trial court found the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal history was a factor in mitigation. In\n\naggravation, the trial court further found that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused or threatened\n\nserious permanent injury to K.K. and that a lengthy sentence was necessary to deter others.\n\nThe trial court sentenced the defendant to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on each count to run\n\nconsecutively. The trial court also imposed a fine of $2500 for each count.\n\n\u00b6 30   The defendant appealed her conviction and sentence arguing, among other things,\n\nthat the trial court failed to consider in mitigation that the defendant had a history of abuse\n\nand maltreatment, which resulted in various mental disorders. This court affirmed the\n\ndefendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.\n\n\u00b6 31   The defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief. In her postconviction\n\npetition, the defendant alleged, among other things, that her defense counsel failed to\n\ninvestigate and call expert and lay witnesses that could have offered mitigating evidence\n\nof domestic violence at sentencing. The trial court summarily dismissed the postconviction\n\npetition. The defendant appealed. This court affirmed the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s\n\npostconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 32   The defendant filed a petition for relief from judgment pursuant to section 2-1401(b-\n\n5) of the Civil Code in which she sought a reduction of sentence or a new sentencing\n\nhearing to present mitigating evidence of domestic violence. The defendant failed to\n\nproperly serve her petition upon the State, and the petition was dismissed without prejudice.\n\n\u00b6 33   Next, the defendant filed a second petition for relief from judgment in which she\n\nsought a reduction of sentence or a new sentencing hearing to present mitigating evidence\n\nof mental illness. The defendant subsequently filed a motion to recharacterize her petition\n\n                                              14\n\fas a postconviction petition and a motion for leave to file a successive postconviction\n\npetition. The State filed no responsive pleadings. The trial court held a hearing on the\n\ndefendant\u2019s filings and indicated that it would rule on those pleadings without a written\n\nresponse from the State.\n\n\u00b6 34   Following the hearing, the defendant filed an amended petition for relief from\n\njudgment pursuant to section 2-1401(b-5). In this petition, the defendant alleged that her\n\nparticipation in the offense was related to her mental illness and domestic violence\n\nperpetrated by an intimate partner and that no evidence of domestic violence was presented\n\nat her sentencing hearing. The defendant further alleged that she was unaware of the\n\nmitigating nature of the evidence of mental illness and domestic violence at the time of\n\nsentencing and could not have learned of its significance sooner through diligence. The\n\ndefendant asserted the \u201cnew\u201d evidence of mental illness and domestic violence against her\n\nwas material and noncumulative to other evidence offered at the sentencing hearing, and\n\nwas of such a conclusive character that it would likely change the sentence imposed by the\n\noriginal trial court. The defendant again sought a reduction in sentence or a new sentencing\n\nhearing at which she could present mitigating evidence of mental illness and domestic\n\nviolence.\n\n\u00b6 35   The defendant attached her own affidavit to the petition. The defendant alleged that\n\nshe was diagnosed with PTSD, dysthymia, and dependent personality disorder. The\n\ndefendant further alleged that Hargrave physically, psychologically, and sexually abused\n\nher and that prior to her marriage to Hargrave, she was in three other abusive marriages.\n\nAccording to the defendant, Hargrave threatened to kill her and K.K. if the defendant did\n\n                                            15\n\fnot participate in the sexual abuse of K.K. The defendant averred that Hargrave possessed\n\nseveral firearms at the time and told the defendant how he would dispose of the bodies of\n\nthe defendant and K.K. The defendant indicated that she believed Hargrave\u2019s threats and\n\nfeared for her and K.K.\u2019s lives. The defendant asserted that defense counsel did not present\n\nthis information for the trial court\u2019s consideration at sentencing.\n\n\u00b6 36   The State again filed no responsive pleading. The trial court entered an order\n\ndenying the defendant\u2019s petitions for relief from judgment, including the amended petition,\n\nand the motion to recharacterize her petition. In denying the defendant\u2019s petitions for relief\n\nfrom judgment, the trial court found that the defendant had presented substantial evidence\n\nof domestic abuse, including Dr. Althoff\u2019s opinions. The trial court determined that based\n\non the record from the bench trial and the sentencing hearing, the defendant could not claim\n\nthat evidence of domestic abuse was not before the court at the time of sentencing or that\n\nshe was unaware of the mitigating nature of such evidence at the time. The trial court\n\nconcluded that \u201c[b]ecause such evidence was not only before the court but also formed the\n\ncore of her defense, Defendant cannot meet the requirement of \u00a72-1401(b-5).\u201d This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\u00b6 37                                 II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 38   On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her a new\n\nsentencing hearing pursuant to section 2-1401(b-5) because no domestic violence evidence\n\nwas presented at her sentencing hearing. The defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s\n\ndenial of her amended petition was improper because, on the petition\u2019s face, it was clear\n\nthat she was entitled to relief as a matter of law.\n\n                                              16\n\f\u00b6 39   A proceeding under section 2-1401 provides a statutory mechanism for vacating\n\nfinal judgments in civil or criminal proceedings.

Green, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2012 IL App (4th) 101034</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 30.\n\n\u00b6 41   In 2016, section 5-5-3.1(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5-5-\n\n3.1(a) (West 2016)) was amended to allow courts to consider evidence of domestic\n\nviolence as a mitigating factor at sentencing. See 730 ILCS 5/5-5-3.1(a)(15) (West 2016).\n\nSection 2-1401 of the Civil Code was also amended to include subsection (b-5), which\n\nallows for relief from judgment based on new evidence of domestic violence. Under section\n\n2-1401(b-5), a petitioner may present a meritorious claim if the petition establishes the\n\nfollowing by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) the petitioner was convicted of a forcible\n\nfelony; (2) the petitioner\u2019s participation in the offense was related to him or her previously\n\nhaving been a victim of domestic violence as perpetrated by an intimate partner; (3) no\n\nevidence of domestic violence against the petitioner was presented at his or her sentencing\n\nhearing; (4) the petitioner was unaware of the mitigating nature of the evidence of the\n\ndomestic violence at the time of sentencing and could not have learned of its significance\n\nsooner through diligence; and (5) the new evidence of domestic violence against the\n\npetitioner is material and noncumulative to other evidence offered at the sentencing\n\nhearing, and is of such a conclusive character that it would likely change the sentence\n\nimposed by the original trial court. 735 ILCS 5/2-1401(b-5) (West 2018). As used in\n\nsubsection (b-5), the term \u201cdomestic violence\u201d means abuse as defined by section 103 of\n\nthe Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986. 735 ILCS 5/2-1401(b-5) (West 2018). Abuse\n\nincludes physical abuse, harassment, interference with personal liberty, or willful\n\ndeprivation. See 750 ILCS 60/103(1) (West 2018).\n\n                                             18\n\f\u00b6 42   Here, the defendant alleged her participation in her offense was related to mental\n\nillness and domestic violence. In her supporting affidavit, the defendant alleged she was\n\ndiagnosed with PTSD, dysthymia, and dependent personality disorder. The defendant\n\nfurther alleged that Hargrave physically, psychologically, and sexually abused her.\n\nAccording to the defendant, Hargrave threatened to kill her and K.K. if the defendant did\n\nnot participate in the sexual abuse of K.K. Hargrave also had several firearms and allegedly\n\ntold the defendant how he was going to dispose of the defendant\u2019s and K.K.\u2019s bodies. The\n\ndefendant indicated that she believed Hargrave\u2019s threats and feared for her and K.K.\u2019s\n\nlives. This was not new evidence of domestic violence nor was it noncumulative to the\n\nother evidence offered at the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing.\n\n\u00b6 43   At trial, the defendant asserted a defense of compulsion as to count I and the trial\n\ncourt heard the testimony of both the defendant and Dr. Althoff. The PSI prepared for\n\nsentencing provided that the defendant claimed she and K.K. were forced to engage in the\n\nsexual activity. The defendant reported that she believed Hargrave had a loaded gun and\n\nwould use it on the defendant and K.K. The defendant claimed that she never did anything\n\nwillingly and had no other choice. Attached to and made part of the PSI were the reports\n\nof Dr. Klug, Dr. Althoff, Dr. Hatlelid, and Lemmon. These reports provided the trial court\n\nwith an account of the defendant\u2019s abusive relationship with Hargrave, and her prior\n\nspouses, as well as opinions as to the defendant\u2019s participation in the offense conduct. Thus,\n\nthe evidence of domestic violence the defendant sought to introduce was contained in the\n\nPSI and its attachments, meaning it was not new or noncumulative to the evidence at\n\nsentencing.\n\n                                             19\n\f\u00b6 44   The defendant claims that the domestic violence evidence was not \u201cpresented\u201d at\n\nher sentencing hearing because defense counsel did not \u201cput on\u201d evidence or argue that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s participation in the offenses was a result of suffering domestic violence from\n\nfour different husbands. The defendant acknowledges, however, that the purported\n\ndomestic violence evidence was a part of the PSI but argues that section 2-1401(b-5)\u2019s\n\npurpose would not be served merely because such evidence was available for the court\u2019s\n\nconsideration even though the record shows that the evidence was \u201cnever actually raised\n\nin court.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 45   At the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court was required to consider the\n\nevidence received at trial and in the PSI. 730 ILCS 5/5-4-1(a)(1), (2) (West 2004). The\n\npurpose of the PSI requirement is to ensure that the trial court will have all necessary\n\ninformation concerning the defendant before imposing a sentence. People v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2031980\"><a href=\"/opinion/2031980/people-v-harris/\">105\n\nIll. 2d 290</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (1985). The PSI is to be presented to and considered by the trial court. See\n\n730 ILCS 5/5-3-1 (West 2004). Thus, we find that the evidence of domestic violence was\n\n\u201cpresented\u201d at the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing for purposes of section 2-1401(b-5)(3).\n\n\u00b6 46   Finally, the purported domestic violence evidence was also not of such a conclusive\n\ncharacter that it would have likely changed the sentence imposed by the original trial court.\n\nAs previously stated, the evidence referenced by the defendant in her petition and affidavit\n\nwas not new. Based on the record, the trial court was well aware of the defendant\u2019s claim\n\nthat she was a victim of domestic violence. When sentencing the defendant, the trial court\n\nrejected the notion that the defendant was a \u201cvictim\u201d or a \u201cbattered woman.\u201d Instead, the\n\ntrial court believed the defendant was a joint perpetrator, and was just as involved as\n\n                                             20\n\fHargrave, if not more so, in the development of the scheme to frame Kukuk. Moreover, we\n\npresume the trial court reviewed and considered the PSI. See People v. Sauseda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2016 IL\n\nApp (1st) 140134</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 20. After reviewing the record of proceedings at sentencing, we cannot\n\nsay that the trial court failed to review and consider the PSI. Accordingly, the record refutes\n\nthe defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed by the original trial court would likely\n\nhave changed.\n\n\u00b6 47                                III.

Leach, appeals from a judgment of conviction. A jury found the\n\ndefendant guilty of aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, a felony, and driving\n\nwhile driver\u2019s license suspended, a misdemeanor. Subsequently, the circuit court sentenced him\n\nto an extended term of imprisonment, plus a term of mandatory supervised release (MSR), for the\n\naggravated-fleeing charge, and a concurrent term of incarceration for the driving-while-suspended\n\ncharge. He has finished serving his sentences, including the term of MSR. The defendant\u2019s court-\n\nappointed attorney on appeal, the Office of the State Appellate Defender (OSAD), has concluded\n\nthat this appeal lacks merit, and on that basis, OSAD has filed with this court a motion to withdraw\n\n                                                 1\n\fas counsel, accompanied by an exhaustive brief in support of the motion. See Anders v. California,\n\n386 U.S. 738 (1967). This court gave the defendant ample opportunity to file a written response\n\nto OSAD\u2019s motion, or a brief, memorandum, etc., explaining why his appeal has merit, but he has\n\nnot taken advantage of that opportunity. Having examined OSAD\u2019s Anders motion and brief,\n\nalong with the entire record on appeal, this court agrees with OSAD that this appeal has no merit.\n\nAccordingly, OSAD is granted leave to withdraw, and the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n\n\u00b63                                    BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64     In October 2016, the defendant was charged by information with aggravated fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer (625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4) (West 2016)), a Class 4 felony. In\n\nJune 2017, the State added a charge of driving while driver\u2019s license suspended (625 ILCS 5/6-\n\n303(a) (West 2016)), a Class A misdemeanor. Trial was repeatedly postponed by the defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion for a fitness evaluation and by other delays occasioned by the defendant.\n\n\u00b65     On July 18, 2018, just before voir dire began, the court admonished the defendant as to the\n\nnature of the charges and the possible penalties. As to the charge of aggravated fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer, the court stated that it was a Class 4 felony punishable by\n\nimprisonment for a term of one to three years, or possibly for an extended term of imprisonment\n\nof up to six years. The range of punishment, the court explained to the defendant, would depend\n\nupon whether the defendant or the State was correct in recollecting the defendant\u2019s criminal\n\nhistory. Voir dire was conducted. A jury was chosen and sworn.\n\n\u00b66     Immediately after voir dire, and with the jurors out of the courtroom, defense counsel told\n\nthe judge that he felt duty-bound to inform the court of great difficulties in communicating with\n\nthe defendant. \u201cThings are becoming aggressive and agitated to the degree that I, frankly, don\u2019t\n\nknow whether he\u2019s going to try to hit me,\u201d counsel stated, adding that the defendant had been\n\n\n                                                2\n\furging him to call a witness who had not been disclosed to the State. The defendant, in answer to\n\nthe court\u2019s query, denied threatening his attorney. The defendant stated that his sole problem with\n\ncounsel was that counsel was refusing to call Alberta VanHoorebeke as a witness, even though\n\ncounsel had known of her for some time, and despite the fact that VanHoorebeke had \u201cshowed up\n\ntoday.\u201d The circuit court noted that it had the authority to decide whether a witness can testify,\n\nbut otherwise the court did not resolve the issue at that time.\n\n\u00b67     The jury was brought into the courtroom. Opening statements were made. For its case in\n\nchief, the State called two witnesses, both of them police officers.\n\n\u00b68     David Morris testified that on October 3, 2016, he was a sergeant with the Harrisburg\n\nPolice Department. That evening, he was dressed in his police uniform, and was on patrol in a\n\nwhite, unmarked car that was equipped with a siren and red and blue emergency lights, in the car\u2019s\n\ninterior. The car did not have a camera on the dash. At dusk, while on Granger Street, Morris saw\n\nthe defendant on a motorcycle, along with a female passenger sitting behind him. The defendant\n\nwas not wearing the required safety glasses, and he turned his head so that Morris could not see\n\nhis face. Morris \u201cturned around to stop him\u201d in order to tell him about the required glasses.\n\nHowever, the defendant then turned onto West College Street, headed westbound on an eastbound-\n\nonly roadway. Morris pursued him. He was approximately half a block behind the defendant\n\nwhen he turned on his emergency lights in an attempt to get the defendant to pull over to the side\n\nof the road. Instead of pulling over, the defendant accelerated. Morris was approximately half a\n\nblock behind the defendant when he turned on his siren.\n\n\u00b69     With his siren and emergency lights activated, Morris pursued the defendant on West\n\nCollege Street. He subsequently pursued him on Ledford Street, Lincoln Street, Sloan Street, and\n\non other public roads. As the defendant slowed for turns, Morris came within 10 to 15 feet of the\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fdefendant, and the defendant looked toward him. With such a short distance between them, and\n\nwith his lights and siren activated, Morris thought \u201cthere\u2019s no way [the defendant] did not know\n\nthat there was an emergency vehicle behind him.\u201d During Morris\u2019s pursuit of the defendant, the\n\ndefendant disobeyed 17 stop signs, disobeyed a traffic-control device at Route 45 and Sloan Street,\n\nfailed to signal several turns to the right or left, and at one point, on Sloan Street past Main Street,\n\nwas going 65 miles per hour in a 30-mile-per-hour zone. When Morris was stopped at a red light\n\non Sloan Street, Logan Leverett, a Saline County Sheriff\u2019s deputy, picked up the pursuit. Morris\u2019s\n\ninvolvement in the pursuit of the defendant had lasted less than one minute.\n\n\u00b6 10    Logan Leverett testified that on October 3, 2016, he was on duty as a sheriff\u2019s deputy in\n\nSaline County. He was in uniform and drove an unmarked police cruiser equipped with red and\n\nblue lights and a siren. The cruiser had a camera on the dashboard, but it was not working. Because\n\nof all that he had heard over his police radio, Leverett was waiting in his car at a gas station on\n\nCommercial Street in Harrisburg. Leverett saw the defendant driving a motorcycle eastbound on\n\nSloan Street, traveling \u201c[a]pproximately 65, 70 miles an hour.\u201d The motorcycle was being\n\nfollowed by a police car. The defendant ran the red light on Sloan Street at Commercial, but the\n\npolice car that was following him did stop for the light. At that point, Leverett picked up the\n\npursuit of the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 11    It was dark outside as Leverett turned on his flashing lights and siren, and drove off the gas\n\nstation\u2019s lot.   The defendant\u2019s motorcycle immediately accelerated.           Leverett followed the\n\ndefendant eastbound on Sloan Street, traveling 65 miles per hour but not catching up to him. The\n\ndefendant \u201cran a stop sign going into the parking lot at Harrisburg Medical Center,\u201d \u201ccontinued\n\nthrough the parking lot onto Wilma Street and eventually laid the bike over in the gravel parking\n\nlot just north of Harrisburg Medical Center.\u201d A female identified as Alberta VanHoorebeke was\n\n\n                                                   4\n\falso on the motorcycle. Leverett took the defendant into custody, and placed him in the backseat\n\nof his cruiser. Because the defendant complained about his shoulder, police took him inside\n\nHarrisburg Medical Center for examination. He was subsequently released to jail personnel.\n\n\u00b6 12   After the State\u2019s two witnesses testified, the State offered into evidence a certified record\n\nfrom the Illinois Secretary of State. It showed that the defendant\u2019s driving privileges were\n\nsuspended on October 3, 2016.\n\n\u00b6 13   The defendant moved for a directed verdict. The court denied the motion.\n\n\u00b6 14   For his case in chief, the defendant called Alberta VanHoorebeke. She recalled an incident\n\nin October 2016, when she was the passenger on the back of a motorcycle that was being driven\n\nby her good friend, the defendant. The defendant had just gotten a phone call informing him that\n\nhis mother was at the local hospital; the two were headed there. It was nighttime. On Granger\n\nStreet, the motorcycle was moving in the same direction as \u201ctwo cop cars.\u201d VanHoorebeke did\n\nnot remember whether these two police cars were marked or unmarked. The two police cars passed\n\nthe motorcycle. When the motorcycle stopped for a stop sign on Granger Street, the two police\n\ncars \u201cturned around,\u201d facing toward the motorcycle. Meanwhile, VanHoorebeke continued, the\n\ndefendant turned right, onto another road. The two police cars followed them. The driver of one\n\ncar activated its flashing red and blue lights and its siren. Soon, that car \u201cgot up really close\u201d to\n\nthe motorcycle and \u201ctried hitting [the] back tire.\u201d The defendant continued driving because the\n\ntwo cars were \u201ccoming at [them] so fast\u201d that \u201cthey probably would have hit [the] back tire.\u201d\n\nVanHoorebeke soon became \u201c[v]ery scared\u201d that the two cars would cause a wreck involving the\n\nmotorcycle. Stopping the motorcycle was nearly impossible in light of the cars\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d\n\nactions. However, there were times when the pursuing cars were relatively far behind them, and\n\nthe defendant had opportunities to stop the motorcycle. As the chase continued, the two original\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fcars were joined by at least three other cars. Although the defendant \u201cslowed down\u201d for stop signs,\n\nhe did not stop completely. The chase ended with the defendant\u2019s \u201cla[ying] the bike down right\n\nthere at the hospital.\u201d The entire incident, starting on Granger Street and ending at the hospital,\n\nlasted 5 to 10 minutes. VanHoorebeke admitted that the chase would have ended if the defendant\n\nhad stopped his motorcycle, and she would have been safe and not needed to worry about an\n\naccident.\n\n\u00b6 15    The defendant, age 47, testified on his own behalf. According to the defendant, he received\n\na telephone call from his sister one night in October 2016, at approximately 10:30, informing him\n\nthat his mother was dying and had been rushed to the hospital. His mother had been in bad shape\n\nas the result of a blood clot. The defendant decided to drive his motorcycle to the hospital. Alberta\n\nVanHoorebeke was his passenger. For the nighttime drive, the defendant wore his \u201cclear glasses.\u201d\n\nOn Granger Street, he was stopped at a stop sign, and two police cars, one marked and the other\n\nunmarked, were nearby. The defendant looked over and \u201cwaved at the officer.\u201d The officer looked\n\nat him. Then, the officer proceeded through the stop sign. However, he \u201cimmediately turned\n\naround\u201d and \u201ccame back.\u201d The other car did likewise. The defendant thought he remembered\n\nsaying, \u201cThey\u2019re pulling us over, Alberta.\u201d The defendant \u201cmade a right, pulled over on the side\n\nof the road right there.\u201d Just then, the officer \u201ccame flying up and tried to hit the back of the bike.\u201d\n\nThe defendant reacted to this movement by \u201cscoot[ing] up a little on the motorcycle.\u201d Just then,\n\n\u201cthe other car came around like that.\u201d The defendant thought that the second car would \u201csmack the\n\nback of the bike,\u201d so he \u201cmoved up a little bit.\u201d Neither car had its siren or flashing lights activated.\n\nThe defendant commented to VanHoorebeke that the police cars were \u201ctrying to hit us.\u201d The\n\ndefendant \u201ctook off\u2014not real fast\u2014maybe 15 miles an hour at the most.\u201d The defendant made a\n\nright turn. One of the officers \u201ccut through\u201d someone\u2019s yard and \u201ctried to swipe the back of the\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fbike.\u201d At that point, the defendant \u201cknew\u201d that the police \u201cwas trying to hit\u201d the motorcycle. \u201cAs\n\nGod is my witness [sic], they were trying to hit us.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16   The defendant was familiar with the driver of one of the two police cars, Officer Morris.\n\nAt some point in the past, the defendant was sitting on his front porch while Morris ran \u201cup and\n\ndown the street\u201d with his gun drawn while yelling, \u201c\u2019Where you at, Jerry Leach?\u2019\u201d Morris\n\napparently thought that the defendant had been the perpetrator of some crime, but ultimately the\n\npolice apprehended someone else that day. The defendant did not know why Morris \u201chad it out\n\nfor [him]\u201d all of the time.\n\n\u00b6 17   Feeling sure that the police were trying to hit his motorcycle, the defendant \u201cgave it a little\n\ngas,\u201d arrived at Ledford and Sloan Streets, \u201cslowed down a little, looked,\u201d and saw that the police\n\n\u201cwere flying up\u201d toward them again. He proceeded through the intersection, with the two police\n\ncars still pursuing him. The pursuit continued in this manner, with three to five police cars\n\neventually joining the original two. The defendant drove as fast as 35 miles per hour on the side\n\nstreets. Near VanHoorebeke\u2019s house, the defendant tried to let VanHoorebeke off the motorcycle,\n\nfor her safety\u2019s sake. He slowed considerably, but he could not stop because the police were too\n\nclose and moving too fast. \u201cThey were right on me. *** The entire time.\u201d During this whole\n\npursuit, one or another police car came within one foot of the motorcycle on several occasions.\n\nAlso, at least one police car had its siren and flashing lights on. The defendant finally decided to\n\n\u201cput the bike down\u201d at the hospital. As for his driver\u2019s license, the defendant did not know that it\n\nwas suspended that day, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the honest to God\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18   For its rebuttal case, the State recalled David Morris. Essentially, Morris testified that\n\nduring his pursuit of the defendant\u2019s motorcycle, he never drove across anyone\u2019s lawn, and the\n\ndefendant had numerous opportunities to stop safely. Morris denied that he ever had displayed a\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fgun while searching for the defendant, but he stated that he had chased the defendant on foot on\n\ntwo prior occasions, without success. Morris did not recognize the motorcycle\u2019s driver as the\n\ndefendant until after he was placed under arrest near the hospital.\n\n\u00b6 19   The jury returned verdicts finding the defendant guilty as charged. That is, the jury found\n\nhim guilty of aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer and of driving while driver\u2019s\n\nlicense suspended.\n\n\u00b6 20   In August 2018, the defendant filed a pro se document captioned, \u201cIssues I\u2019d Like to Raise\n\non Record, for Purpose of Securing My Rights on Appeal.\u201d In that document, the defendant\n\ndiscussed a wide variety of issues relating to pretrial and trial proceedings, including claims of\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel.    (The court apparently viewed that document as an\n\nexpression of the defendant\u2019s desire for an appeal; the court did not consider the document a\n\nposttrial motion, and never mentioned the document until well after the defendant\u2019s sentencing.)\n\n\u00b6 21   On August 29, 2018, and September 12, 2018, the court held a sentencing hearing. The\n\npresentence investigation report, upon which the court relied, showed that the defendant had an\n\nextensive criminal record dating back to 1990, when the defendant was convicted of burglary and\n\ntwo battery charges in three separate case files from Cook County, Illinois. The defendant\n\nprovided the only live testimony at the sentencing hearing, describing the circumstances of his\n\nrecent dismissal from a drug-rehabilitation program, and his potential for rehabilitation generally.\n\nThe State pointed out that the defendant, at the time he committed the two instant offenses, was\n\non pretrial release in two unrelated Saline County felony cases. The State also presented certified\n\ncopies of the defendant\u2019s convictions in four felony cases from Franklin County, Illinois. These\n\nincluded a conviction for aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony, in case No. 06-CF-221, for which\n\nthe defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6\u00bd years. In the instant case, the circuit\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fcourt sentenced the defendant as follows: for aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police\n\nofficer, imprisonment for an extended term of five years, plus one year of MSR, and for driving\n\nwhile driver\u2019s license suspended, 364 days of incarceration, concurrent with the prison sentence.\n\n\u00b6 22   In October 2018, the defendant simultaneously filed, pro se, a motion to reduce sentence\n\nand a notice of appeal. In November 2018, the defendant\u2019s appointed attorney on appeal, OSAD,\n\nfiled in this court a motion to dismiss the appeal as premature. This court granted the motion to\n\ndismiss the appeal.\n\n\u00b6 23   With the case back before the circuit court, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was granted leave\n\nto withdraw. The court appointed a new posttrial attorney.\n\n\u00b6 24   In March 2019, the new posttrial attorney filed, on behalf of the defendant, a motion for a\n\nnew trial and a motion to reconsider sentence. In the former motion, the defendant claimed that\n\nvarious specified errors by the trial court and trial counsel had deprived him of a fair trial. In the\n\nlatter motion, he alleged that his sentence was excessive, and that the sentencing court ignored\n\nmitigating factors.\n\n\u00b6 25   In April 2019, the defendant filed a handwritten pro se document describing a wide variety\n\nof alleged errors by trial counsel, the trial prosecutor, and the trial court. In May 2019, the\n\ndefendant filed a handwritten pro se document captioned, \u201cIssues to be Raised and Placed on\n\nRecord for Preserving Appeal Rights.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26   In June 2019, the defendant, by posttrial counsel, filed a \u201cfirst amended motion for new\n\ntrial.\u201d This first amended motion included all of the claims found in the original motion filed in\n\nMarch 2019, plus a few more claims that the defendant personally wanted to include, for a grand\n\ntotal of 28 claims. (More information about these 28 claims will be presented in the analysis\n\nportion of this order, infra.) The State filed a written response to the first amended motion.\n\n\n                                                  9\n\f\u00b6 27   On July 2, 2019, the court held a hearing on the \u201cfirst amended motion for a new trial,\u201d\n\nfiled in June 2019, and the motion to reduce sentence, filed in March 2019. Posttrial counsel\n\ninformed the court that all of the defendant\u2019s pro se claims had been incorporated into the first\n\namended motion for new trial. No witnesses testified at this hearing. Defense counsel briefly\n\nargued in favor of a few of the claims presented in his first amended motion for a new trial.\n\nSpecifically, counsel argued (1) that the court erred in failing to definitively state, prior to the\n\ncommencement of the defendant\u2019s trial, whether the defendant was eligible for extended-term\n\nsentencing; (2) that the trial court erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance\n\nof the trial; (3) that the trial court erred in allowing evidence that the defendant had active warrants\n\nat the time of the offenses; (4) that the trial court erred in denying the defense motion for a directed\n\nverdict; (5) that trial counsel had failed to attempt to contact a defense witness, Jennifer\n\nQuertermous; and (6) that trial counsel had failed to cross-examine police officer David Morris\n\nabout \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d between his trial testimony and his written police report, such as his location\n\nwhen he first contacted dispatch, and the defendant\u2019s wearing or not wearing safety glasses. As\n\nfor all the other claims in the first amended motion for a new trial, defense counsel stood on the\n\nmotion. The defendant personally argued that portions of Morris\u2019s testimony were simply not\n\ncredible. At the hearing\u2019s end, the court took the matters under advisement.\n\n\u00b6 28    On July 31, 2019, in a docket-entry order, the court denied both the first amended motion\n\nfor a new trial and the motion to reduce sentence. According to the court, every one of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s claims was \u201cfactually inaccurate and or lacks legal merit.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29    In August 2019, the defendant filed, by counsel, a notice of appeal, thus perfecting the\n\ninstant appeal. The circuit court appointed OSAD to represent the defendant on appeal. OSAD\n\nsubsequently filed an amended notice of appeal.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f\u00b6 30                                     ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 31    This appeal is from a judgment of conviction. As previously mentioned, the defendant\u2019s\n\nappointed attorney on appeal, OSAD, has concluded that this appeal lacks merit, and accordingly\n\nit has filed an Anders motion to withdraw as counsel. This court agrees with OSAD\u2019s assessment\n\nof this appeal. Therefore, OSAD\u2019s Anders motion must be granted, and the judgment of conviction\n\nmust be affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 32    In the brief that accompanies the Anders motion, OSAD addresses four potential issues on\n\nappeal. They are (1) whether the State failed to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt; (2) whether any sentencing considerations are still justiciable in light of the fact that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s sentence, including his term of MSR, has expired; (3) whether trial counsel provided\n\nineffective assistance; and (4) whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial by any of the\n\nseveral errors that he alleged the trial court and the State had committed. This court addresses\n\nthese potential issues in turn.\n\n\u00b6 33    The first potential issue presented by OSAD is whether the State proved the defendant\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, the State bears the burden of proving a defendant guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 367 (1970).\n\nOn review, an appellate court will reverse a conviction only if, while viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the State, it concludes that no \u201crational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\n\n319 (1979); People v. Cunningham, 212 Ill. 2d 274, 278 (2004). The trier of fact determines the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses. People v. Evans, 209 Ill. 2d 194, 211 (2004). The jury, acting as the\n\ntrier of fact, is responsible for assigning weight to the testimony of witnesses, for resolving\n\ninconsistencies or conflicts in the evidence, and for drawing reasonable inferences therefrom.\n\n\n                                                11\n\fPeople v. Sutherland, 223 Ill. 2d 187, 242 (2006). \u201cThe testimony of a single witness, if it is\n\npositive and the witness credible, is sufficient to convict.\u201d People v. Smith, 185 Ill. 2d 532, 541\n\n(1999).\n\n\u00b6 34      In the instant case, the defendant was on trial for two offenses. They were (1) aggravated\n\nfleeing or attempting to elude a police officer (625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4) (West 2016)) and\n\n(2) driving while driver\u2019s license suspended (625 ILCS 5/6-303(a) (West 2016)).\n\n\u00b6 35      As to the first of these two offenses, the aggravated-fleeing count, the court properly\n\ninstructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty, it had to find that five propositions\n\nhad been proved, viz.: (1) that the defendant was the driver or operator of a motor vehicle; (2) that\n\nthe defendant was given a visual or audible signal by a police officer directing him to bring his\n\nvehicle to a stop; (3) that the peace officer was in police uniform, and, if the officer was driving a\n\nvehicle, that the vehicle displayed illuminated, oscillating, rotating, or flashing red or blue lights,\n\nwhich when used in conjunction with an audible horn or siren, would indicate the vehicle to be an\n\nofficial police vehicle; (4) that the defendant willfully failed or refused to obey such signal in order\n\nto flee or attempt to elude the officer; and (5) that such flight or attempt to elude by the defendant\n\ninvolved disobedience of two or more traffic control devices. Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions,\n\nCriminal, No. 23.02, modified; 625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4) (West 2016).                The State\u2019s two\n\nwitnesses, police officers Morris and Leverett, provided abundant testimony on each of these five\n\npropositions.    Moreover, the defendant\u2014or his witness, Alberta VanHoorebeke\u2014essentially\n\nadmitted to these five propositions (except for the one about the police officers being in uniform).\n\nFor example, the defendant testified that he thought the police wanted him to pull over his\n\nmotorcycle, and that he saw flashing lights, and heard a siren, from at least one of the police cars\n\nthat followed him.\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f\u00b6 36   The defendant sought to defend himself against this aggravated-fleeing charge by asserting\n\nthat his actions were necessary to avoid a wreck. Thus, the defendant\u2019s defense added a sixth\n\nelement to the offense\u2014\u201c[t]hat the defendant did not act out of necessity.\u201d Illinois Pattern Jury\n\nInstructions, Criminal, No. 24-25.22A. The jury was so instructed. The definition of necessity\n\nwas also given to the jury. It read:\n\n       \u201cConduct which would otherwise be an offense is justifiable by reason of necessity if the\n\n       defendant was without blame in occasioning or developing the situation and reasonably\n\n       believed that such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than\n\n       the injury which might reasonably result from his own conduct.\u201d Illinois Pattern Jury\n\n       Instructions, Criminal, No. 24-25.22; 720 ILCS 5/7-13 (West 2016).\n\nIt is no wonder that a necessity defense was unsuccessful. Everyone who testified at the trial,\n\nwhether for the State or for the defense, made clear that the defendant had plenty of opportunity\n\nto pull over; he did not need to take the officers on this ridiculous chase that endangered everyone\n\non the road that evening, including his passenger on the motorcycle. Even the defendant testified\n\nthat when the police first turned around on Granger Street and attempted to stop him, the defendant\n\n\u201cmade a right [onto West College Street], pulled over on the side of the road right there.\u201d He\n\nshould have remained on the side of the road. If he had, this entire chase could have been avoided.\n\nA rational trier of fact certainly could have found the essential elements of aggravated fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer, and found them beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u00b6 37   As to the second of the defendant\u2019s two offenses, i.e., driving while driver\u2019s license\n\nsuspended, the State had no difficulty in proving its two elements\u2014(1) that the defendant was\n\ndriving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on any highway of this state, and (2) that\n\nhis driver\u2019s license was suspended at the time. 625 ILCS 5/6-303(a) (West 2016). The defendant\n\n\n                                                13\n\fadmitted to the two elements, and the State produced a certified copy of the driving abstract from\n\nthe Illinois Secretary of State showing that his license was indeed suspended on October 3, 2016.\n\nThe fact that the defendant was unaware of the suspension at the time he drove makes no difference\n\nfor this absolute-liability offense. See People v. Espenscheid, 109 Ill. App. 2d 107, 111 (1969)\n\n(\u201cmental state\u201d is not involved in the offense of driving while driver\u2019s license suspended).\n\n\u00b6 38   In short, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, on both charges, was overwhelming. It was\n\nas close as real life comes to being an open-and-shut case.\n\n\u00b6 39   The second potential issue presented by OSAD is whether any sentencing considerations\n\nare still justiciable in light of the fact that the defendant\u2019s sentence, including his term of MSR,\n\nhas been completed. In the \u201cfirst amended motion for new trial,\u201d the defendant alleged that he was\n\nnot given sufficient notice that he was subject to an extended term. In the motion to reconsider\n\nsentence, he alleged that his sentence was excessive in light of mitigating factors. However, as\n\nthe website of the Illinois Department of Corrections (DOC) seems to suggest, and as OSAD\u2019s and\n\nthis court\u2019s calculations make perfectly clear, the defendant has completed his entire sentence,\n\nincluding the term of MSR. The defendant\u2019s name does not appear in the DOC\u2019s inmate-search\n\ndatabase, suggesting that he has completed MSR. It was on September 12, 2018, that the court\n\nsentenced the defendant to an extended term of imprisonment of five years for aggravated fleeing\n\nor attempting to elude a police officer, to be followed by one year of MSR, and 364 days for driving\n\nwhile driver\u2019s license suspended, concurrent with the aggravated-fleeing sentence. He received\n\ncredit for 494 days of presentence incarceration, and he was eligible for day-for-day good-conduct\n\ncredit. See 730 ILCS 5/3-6-3(a)(2.1) (West 2016) (except for enumerated offenses, prisoner shall\n\nreceive \u201cone day of sentence credit for each day of his or her sentence of imprisonment\u201d). Taking\n\neverything into account, the defendant would have finished his year of MSR in early November\n\n\n                                                14\n\f2020, more than 1\u00bd years ago. \u201cSince the sentence has been served, the question of the validity\n\nof its imposition is moot, and it is unnecessary for this court to consider it further.\u201d People v.\n\nMurrell, 60 Ill. 2d 287, 294 (1975).\n\n\u00b6 40   Even if the sentencing issues were not moot, they are meritless. For example, his claim\n\nthat he was not eligible for extended-term sentencing for aggravated fleeing, a Class 4 felony, is\n\nmeritless due to his prior conviction for aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony, in Franklin County\n\ncase No. 06-CF-221, a crime for which he was sentenced to 6\u00bd years of imprisonment. See 730\n\nILCS 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 2016) (reasons to impose an extended-term sentence). (OSAD wrote\n\nthat the defendant was extended-term eligible by virtue of his Class 3 felony conviction in Franklin\n\nCounty case No. 07-CF-387. However, the trial prosecutor, during a discussion just prior to\n\nvoir dire, indicated that that particular conviction had been reversed on appeal.)\n\n\u00b6 41   The third potential issue presented by OSAD is whether trial counsel provided ineffective\n\nassistance. Generally, when a defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, he must make\n\ntwo separate showings: (1) that counsel\u2019s assistance was deficient, i.e., that it fell below an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that there is a reasonable likelihood that counsel\u2019s\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant, so that the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984). \u201c[I]n order to establish\n\ndeficient performance, the defendant must overcome the strong presumption that the challenged\n\naction or inaction may have been the product of sound trial strategy,\u201d and \u201c[m]atters of trial\n\nstrategy are generally immune from claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d (Internal\n\nquotation marks omitted.) People v. Manning, 241 Ill. 2d 319, 327 (2011). \u201c[D]ecisions regarding\n\nwhat matters to object to and when to object are matters of trial strategy.\u201d (Internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted.) People v. Perry, 224 Ill. 2d 312, 344 (2007). To make out a claim of ineffective\n\n\n                                                15\n\fassistance of counsel, \u201c[a] defendant must satisfy both prongs of the Strickland test,\u201d but \u201cif the\n\nineffective-assistance claim can be disposed of on the ground that the defendant did not suffer\n\nprejudice, a court need not decide whether counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient.\u201d\n\nPeople v. Griffin, 178 Ill. 2d 65, 74 (1997).\n\n\u00b6 42    The defendant and posttrial counsel raised several claims of ineffective assistance by trial\n\ncounsel. In its Anders brief, OSAD specifically mentions that trial counsel (1) failed to subpoena\n\nand call a witness named Jennifer Quertermous, who would have \u201cimpeached\u201d the testimony of\n\nState\u2019s witness Morris, (2) failed to subpoena dash camera footage, (3) failed to subpoena a police\n\nlog to see which officers were working that night, (4) failed to show him the discovery, (5) failed\n\nto investigate his issues, and (6) failed to determine whether College Street was two-way after\n\nschool hours. However, OSAD then states that \u201cthe claims about discovery, which evidence to\n\nsubpoena, which witnesses to call, and which witnesses to investigate are all undermined by the\n\nfact that, according to what [trial counsel] told the judge in open court, [the defendant] was a no-\n\ncall/no-show at three separate meetings [counsel] had scheduled for them prior to trial, on June 11,\n\nJuly 2, and July 17, 2018.\u201d It is true that trial counsel told the judge that the defendant had failed\n\nto appear for meetings on those dates, and that the purpose of those meetings was, in trial counsel\u2019s\n\nwords, \u201cto try to make sure that [the defendant] was competently represented, that we could present\n\na defense\u201d including \u201cwitnesses [the defendant] may want to call.\u201d As OSAD comments, \u201c[the\n\ndefendant] alleges several failures by [trial counsel], but the failure is really [the defendant\u2019s]\n\nfailure to show up to the meetings at which he and [defense counsel] were supposed to accomplish\n\nthe very things [the defendant] is now complaining did not get done.\u201d Certainly, the defendant did\n\nnot dispute that his attorney had scheduled those meetings or that he himself had failed to attend\n\nthem.\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f\u00b6 43   Moreover, as OSAD also states, the defendant cannot show prejudice from any of these\n\nalleged failures by counsel. Indeed, he failed to show prejudice when he had the opportunity to\n\nshow it in the circuit court. The defendant certainly cannot expect a reviewing court to divine the\n\nprejudice visited upon him by trial counsel\u2019s supposed errors. As discussed supra, the combined\n\ntestimonies of the defendant and of defense witness VanHoorebeke served to provide (essentially)\n\nall of the evidence needed to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is\n\nno reasonable probability that the trial\u2019s result would have been any different if trial counsel had\n\nperformed differently.\n\n\u00b6 44   The fourth potential issue presented by OSAD is whether the defendant was deprived of a\n\nfair trial by any of the several errors that he alleged the trial court and the State had committed.\n\nThe defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying a directed verdict, in not allowing the\n\njury to hear the directed verdict motion and ruling, and in allowing evidence that the defendant\n\nhad active warrants at the time he fled police on October 3, 2016. The defendant claimed that the\n\nState erred in telling witness VanHoorebeke to stop looking at the defendant and asking her\n\nwhether she was afraid of the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 45   When deciding a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court determines only whether a\n\nreasonable mind could fairly conclude the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, while\n\nconsidering the evidence most strongly in the State\u2019s favor. In moving for a directed verdict, the\n\ndefendant admits the truth of the facts stated in the State\u2019s evidence, for purposes of the motion.\n\nPeople v. Aljohani, 2021 IL App (1st) 190692, \u00b6 78. Without question, once you admit the truth\n\nof the trial testimonies of Morris and Leverett, plus the certified driving abstract, a reasonable mind\n\ncould fairly conclude that the defendant was guilty of both charges against him, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Also, there is no absolute right to make any argument at all on a motion for\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fdirected verdict. People v. Withers, 87 Ill. 2d 224, 230-31 (1981). Given that there is no right to\n\nargue, there cannot be a right to have the jury hear that argument. Additionally, the motion for\n\ndirected verdict is a purely legal matter, entirely within the purview of the trial court; there is\n\nnothing for the jury to do regarding such a motion. There was no error in the court\u2019s denying the\n\ndefendant\u2019s directed-verdict motion, or in the manner in which the court denied it. (Frankly, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine why the defendant would have wanted the jury to hear his motion for a directed\n\nverdict and the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion. The jury may have viewed the ruling as the\n\ncircuit court\u2019s endorsement of the defendant\u2019s guilt.)\n\n\u00b6 46   There also was no error in allowing the State to present evidence that the defendant had\n\noutstanding \u201cwarrants for [his] arrest\u201d at the time he fled from the police. Although \u201c[e]vidence\n\nof other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person,\u201d such evidence\n\nmay be admissible for \u201cother purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Ill. R. Evid. 404(b) (eff. Jan. 1,\n\n2011). In the instant case, evidence that the defendant had outstanding warrants against him was\n\nadmissible for the purpose of proving his motive for fleeing the police. The defendant testified\n\nthat he had sped away from the officers in order to avoid a wreck and injury to his passenger. The\n\nState was permitted to present evidence of a very different motive\u2014to escape an arrest on\n\noutstanding warrants. (That is especially the case where the evidence did not even mention the\n\ncrimes\u2014aggravated battery and unlawful possession of a converted license plate\u2014for which the\n\ndefendant was wanted, thus minimizing prejudice to the defendant.)\n\n\u00b6 47   Also, there was no error in the State\u2019s telling witness VanHoorebeke to stop looking at the\n\ndefendant and asking her whether she was afraid of the defendant. \u201c[A] trial court can generally\n\ncorrect any error resulting from an improper remark by sustaining an objection or instructing the\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fjury to disregard the statement.\u201d People v. Bell, 343 Ill. App. 3d 110, 116 (2003). In this case,\n\nwhen the State made the statement and asked the question that it did, trial counsel for the defendant\n\ninterposed an objection. The trial court then chided the State, stating that witness VanHoorebeke\n\nwas free to look at the defendant. \u201cIf you think [the defendant] is doing something inappropriate,\n\nyou can bring that to the Court\u2019s attention. She can look at me. She can look at you. She can look\n\nat the jury. So that objection will be sustained.\u201d Given the strength of the evidence against the\n\ndefendant\u2014evidence from both the State\u2019s witnesses, and the defendant and his witness\u2014there is\n\nnothing to the argument that this limited episode deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\n\n\u00b6 48   As for the remainder of the issues presented in the \u201cfirst amended motion for new trial,\u201d\n\nand the motion to reconsider sentence, they are, in the words of OSAD, \u201cirrelevant, wholly\n\nconclusory, or rebutted by the record.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 49   An example of an irrelevant claim is the defendant\u2019s argument that he could not be guilty\n\nof driving while license suspended because he never had a motorcycle license. However, \u201cdriver\u2019s\n\nlicense\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny license to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of this State.\u201d\n\n625 ILCS 5/1-116.1 (West 2016). Whether his license had an \u201cM\u201d classification permitting him\n\nto drive a motorcycle is irrelevant.\n\n\u00b6 50   Examples of wholly conclusory claims are the defendant\u2019s claims that \u201c[t]he manner of\n\njury selection was improper,\u201d \u201d[t]he manner of arraignment was improper,\u201d \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s\n\nright to speedy trial was violated,\u201d \u201c[t]he state engaged in malicious prosecution,\u201d \u201c[t]he\n\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights were violated,\u201d and portions of the testimonies of State\u2019s witnesses\n\nMorris and Leverett were \u201cirrelevant, immaterial, and/or too prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d None\n\nof those claims was accompanied by any specifics at all. A defendant must state \u201cspecific grounds\n\nfor objection\u201d if he wants to preserve an issue for appeal. People v. Johnson, 219 Ill. App. 3d 949,\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f951 (1991). \u201c[M]erely vague, general allegations of error in a posttrial motion are insufficient to\n\npreserve a claim for appeal\u201d and will result in \u201cthe waiver of the issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\n\nomitted.) People v. Lenz, 2019 IL App (2d) 180124, \u00b6 79. The defendant\u2019s wholly conclusory\n\narguments are waived. Also, there was no contemporaneous objection relating to Morris\u2019s or\n\nLeverett\u2019s testimony, or to the manner of jury selection, so those issues are waived for that reason\n\ntoo. See People v. McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d 478, 485 (2009) (\u201cto preserve a claim of error for review,\n\ncounsel must object to the error at trial and raise the error in a motion for a new trial before the\n\ntrial court\u201d). In addition, this court cannot identify anything at all improper or erroneous in any of\n\nthese matters.\n\n\u00b6 51   Finally, some of the defendant\u2019s claims are flat-out rebutted by the record. For example,\n\nthe defendant claimed that the jury \u201cheard\u201d his trial attorney comment that he feared the defendant\n\nmight punch him in the face. As this court has noted, supra, the jury was not in the room at the\n\ntime the comment was made; there is no reason to imagine that the jury heard the prejudicial\n\ncomment.\n\n\u00b6 52                                   CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 53   For all of the reasons stated above, this appeal has no merit whatsoever. Accordingly,\n\nOSAD\u2019s Anders motion for leave to withdraw as counsel is granted, and the circuit court\u2019s\n\njudgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\u00b6 54   Motion granted; judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                     </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (5th) 190362-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n            NOTICE\n                                                                                         NOTICE\n Decision filed 07/08/22.

Leach, appeals from a judgment of conviction. A jury found the\n\ndefendant guilty of aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, a felony, and driving\n\nwhile driver\u2019s license suspended, a misdemeanor. Subsequently, the circuit court sentenced him\n\nto an extended term of imprisonment, plus a term of mandatory supervised release (MSR), for the\n\naggravated-fleeing charge, and a concurrent term of incarceration for the driving-while-suspended\n\ncharge. He has finished serving his sentences, including the term of MSR. The defendant\u2019s court-\n\nappointed attorney on appeal, the Office of the State Appellate Defender (OSAD), has concluded\n\nthat this appeal lacks merit, and on that basis, OSAD has filed with this court a motion to withdraw\n\n                                                 1\n\fas counsel, accompanied by an exhaustive brief in support of the motion. See Anders v. California,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\">386 U.S. 738</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967). This court gave the defendant ample opportunity to file a written response\n\nto OSAD\u2019s motion, or a brief, memorandum, etc., explaining why his appeal has merit, but he has\n\nnot taken advantage of that opportunity. Having examined OSAD\u2019s Anders motion and brief,\n\nalong with the entire record on appeal, this court agrees with OSAD that this appeal has no merit.\n\nAccordingly, OSAD is granted leave to withdraw, and the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n\n\u00b63                                    BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64     In October 2016, the defendant was charged by information with aggravated fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer (625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4) (West 2016)), a Class 4 felony. In\n\nJune 2017, the State added a charge of driving while driver\u2019s license suspended (625 ILCS 5/6-\n\n303(a) (West 2016)), a Class A misdemeanor. Trial was repeatedly postponed by the defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion for a fitness evaluation and by other delays occasioned by the defendant.\n\n\u00b65     On July 18, 2018, just before voir dire began, the court admonished the defendant as to the\n\nnature of the charges and the possible penalties. As to the charge of aggravated fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer, the court stated that it was a Class 4 felony punishable by\n\nimprisonment for a term of one to three years, or possibly for an extended term of imprisonment\n\nof up to six years. The range of punishment, the court explained to the defendant, would depend\n\nupon whether the defendant or the State was correct in recollecting the defendant\u2019s criminal\n\nhistory. Voir dire was conducted. A jury was chosen and sworn.\n\n\u00b66     Immediately after voir dire, and with the jurors out of the courtroom, defense counsel told\n\nthe judge that he felt duty-bound to inform the court of great difficulties in communicating with\n\nthe defendant. \u201cThings are becoming aggressive and agitated to the degree that I, frankly, don\u2019t\n\nknow whether he\u2019s going to try to hit me,\u201d counsel stated, adding that the defendant had been\n\n\n                                                2\n\furging him to call a witness who had not been disclosed to the State. The defendant, in answer to\n\nthe court\u2019s query, denied threatening his attorney. The defendant stated that his sole problem with\n\ncounsel was that counsel was refusing to call Alberta VanHoorebeke as a witness, even though\n\ncounsel had known of her for some time, and despite the fact that VanHoorebeke had \u201cshowed up\n\ntoday.\u201d The circuit court noted that it had the authority to decide whether a witness can testify,\n\nbut otherwise the court did not resolve the issue at that time.\n\n\u00b67     The jury was brought into the courtroom. Opening statements were made. For its case in\n\nchief, the State called two witnesses, both of them police officers.\n\n\u00b68     David Morris testified that on October 3, 2016, he was a sergeant with the Harrisburg\n\nPolice Department. That evening, he was dressed in his police uniform, and was on patrol in a\n\nwhite, unmarked car that was equipped with a siren and red and blue emergency lights, in the car\u2019s\n\ninterior. The car did not have a camera on the dash. At dusk, while on Granger Street, Morris saw\n\nthe defendant on a motorcycle, along with a female passenger sitting behind him. The defendant\n\nwas not wearing the required safety glasses, and he turned his head so that Morris could not see\n\nhis face. Morris \u201cturned around to stop him\u201d in order to tell him about the required glasses.\n\nHowever, the defendant then turned onto West College Street, headed westbound on an eastbound-\n\nonly roadway. Morris pursued him. He was approximately half a block behind the defendant\n\nwhen he turned on his emergency lights in an attempt to get the defendant to pull over to the side\n\nof the road. Instead of pulling over, the defendant accelerated. Morris was approximately half a\n\nblock behind the defendant when he turned on his siren.\n\n\u00b69     With his siren and emergency lights activated, Morris pursued the defendant on West\n\nCollege Street. He subsequently pursued him on Ledford Street, Lincoln Street, Sloan Street, and\n\non other public roads. As the defendant slowed for turns, Morris came within 10 to 15 feet of the\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fdefendant, and the defendant looked toward him. With such a short distance between them, and\n\nwith his lights and siren activated, Morris thought \u201cthere\u2019s no way [the defendant] did not know\n\nthat there was an emergency vehicle behind him.\u201d During Morris\u2019s pursuit of the defendant, the\n\ndefendant disobeyed 17 stop signs, disobeyed a traffic-control device at Route 45 and Sloan Street,\n\nfailed to signal several turns to the right or left, and at one point, on Sloan Street past Main Street,\n\nwas going 65 miles per hour in a 30-mile-per-hour zone. When Morris was stopped at a red light\n\non Sloan Street, Logan Leverett, a Saline County Sheriff\u2019s deputy, picked up the pursuit. Morris\u2019s\n\ninvolvement in the pursuit of the defendant had lasted less than one minute.\n\n\u00b6 10    Logan Leverett testified that on October 3, 2016, he was on duty as a sheriff\u2019s deputy in\n\nSaline County. He was in uniform and drove an unmarked police cruiser equipped with red and\n\nblue lights and a siren. The cruiser had a camera on the dashboard, but it was not working. Because\n\nof all that he had heard over his police radio, Leverett was waiting in his car at a gas station on\n\nCommercial Street in Harrisburg. Leverett saw the defendant driving a motorcycle eastbound on\n\nSloan Street, traveling \u201c[a]pproximately 65, 70 miles an hour.\u201d The motorcycle was being\n\nfollowed by a police car. The defendant ran the red light on Sloan Street at Commercial, but the\n\npolice car that was following him did stop for the light. At that point, Leverett picked up the\n\npursuit of the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 11    It was dark outside as Leverett turned on his flashing lights and siren, and drove off the gas\n\nstation\u2019s lot.   The defendant\u2019s motorcycle immediately accelerated.           Leverett followed the\n\ndefendant eastbound on Sloan Street, traveling 65 miles per hour but not catching up to him. The\n\ndefendant \u201cran a stop sign going into the parking lot at Harrisburg Medical Center,\u201d \u201ccontinued\n\nthrough the parking lot onto Wilma Street and eventually laid the bike over in the gravel parking\n\nlot just north of Harrisburg Medical Center.\u201d A female identified as Alberta VanHoorebeke was\n\n\n                                                   4\n\falso on the motorcycle. Leverett took the defendant into custody, and placed him in the backseat\n\nof his cruiser. Because the defendant complained about his shoulder, police took him inside\n\nHarrisburg Medical Center for examination. He was subsequently released to jail personnel.\n\n\u00b6 12   After the State\u2019s two witnesses testified, the State offered into evidence a certified record\n\nfrom the Illinois Secretary of State. It showed that the defendant\u2019s driving privileges were\n\nsuspended on October 3, 2016.\n\n\u00b6 13   The defendant moved for a directed verdict. The court denied the motion.\n\n\u00b6 14   For his case in chief, the defendant called Alberta VanHoorebeke. She recalled an incident\n\nin October 2016, when she was the passenger on the back of a motorcycle that was being driven\n\nby her good friend, the defendant. The defendant had just gotten a phone call informing him that\n\nhis mother was at the local hospital; the two were headed there. It was nighttime. On Granger\n\nStreet, the motorcycle was moving in the same direction as \u201ctwo cop cars.\u201d VanHoorebeke did\n\nnot remember whether these two police cars were marked or unmarked. The two police cars passed\n\nthe motorcycle. When the motorcycle stopped for a stop sign on Granger Street, the two police\n\ncars \u201cturned around,\u201d facing toward the motorcycle. Meanwhile, VanHoorebeke continued, the\n\ndefendant turned right, onto another road. The two police cars followed them. The driver of one\n\ncar activated its flashing red and blue lights and its siren. Soon, that car \u201cgot up really close\u201d to\n\nthe motorcycle and \u201ctried hitting [the] back tire.\u201d The defendant continued driving because the\n\ntwo cars were \u201ccoming at [them] so fast\u201d that \u201cthey probably would have hit [the] back tire.\u201d\n\nVanHoorebeke soon became \u201c[v]ery scared\u201d that the two cars would cause a wreck involving the\n\nmotorcycle. Stopping the motorcycle was nearly impossible in light of the cars\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d\n\nactions. However, there were times when the pursuing cars were relatively far behind them, and\n\nthe defendant had opportunities to stop the motorcycle. As the chase continued, the two original\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fcars were joined by at least three other cars. Although the defendant \u201cslowed down\u201d for stop signs,\n\nhe did not stop completely. The chase ended with the defendant\u2019s \u201cla[ying] the bike down right\n\nthere at the hospital.\u201d The entire incident, starting on Granger Street and ending at the hospital,\n\nlasted 5 to 10 minutes. VanHoorebeke admitted that the chase would have ended if the defendant\n\nhad stopped his motorcycle, and she would have been safe and not needed to worry about an\n\naccident.\n\n\u00b6 15    The defendant, age 47, testified on his own behalf. According to the defendant, he received\n\na telephone call from his sister one night in October 2016, at approximately 10:30, informing him\n\nthat his mother was dying and had been rushed to the hospital. His mother had been in bad shape\n\nas the result of a blood clot. The defendant decided to drive his motorcycle to the hospital. Alberta\n\nVanHoorebeke was his passenger. For the nighttime drive, the defendant wore his \u201cclear glasses.\u201d\n\nOn Granger Street, he was stopped at a stop sign, and two police cars, one marked and the other\n\nunmarked, were nearby. The defendant looked over and \u201cwaved at the officer.\u201d The officer looked\n\nat him. Then, the officer proceeded through the stop sign. However, he \u201cimmediately turned\n\naround\u201d and \u201ccame back.\u201d The other car did likewise. The defendant thought he remembered\n\nsaying, \u201cThey\u2019re pulling us over, Alberta.\u201d The defendant \u201cmade a right, pulled over on the side\n\nof the road right there.\u201d Just then, the officer \u201ccame flying up and tried to hit the back of the bike.\u201d\n\nThe defendant reacted to this movement by \u201cscoot[ing] up a little on the motorcycle.\u201d Just then,\n\n\u201cthe other car came around like that.\u201d The defendant thought that the second car would \u201csmack the\n\nback of the bike,\u201d so he \u201cmoved up a little bit.\u201d Neither car had its siren or flashing lights activated.\n\nThe defendant commented to VanHoorebeke that the police cars were \u201ctrying to hit us.\u201d The\n\ndefendant \u201ctook off\u2014not real fast\u2014maybe 15 miles an hour at the most.\u201d The defendant made a\n\nright turn. One of the officers \u201ccut through\u201d someone\u2019s yard and \u201ctried to swipe the back of the\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fbike.\u201d At that point, the defendant \u201cknew\u201d that the police \u201cwas trying to hit\u201d the motorcycle. \u201cAs\n\nGod is my witness [sic], they were trying to hit us.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16   The defendant was familiar with the driver of one of the two police cars, Officer Morris.\n\nAt some point in the past, the defendant was sitting on his front porch while Morris ran \u201cup and\n\ndown the street\u201d with his gun drawn while yelling, \u201c\u2019Where you at, Jerry Leach?\u2019\u201d Morris\n\napparently thought that the defendant had been the perpetrator of some crime, but ultimately the\n\npolice apprehended someone else that day. The defendant did not know why Morris \u201chad it out\n\nfor [him]\u201d all of the time.\n\n\u00b6 17   Feeling sure that the police were trying to hit his motorcycle, the defendant \u201cgave it a little\n\ngas,\u201d arrived at Ledford and Sloan Streets, \u201cslowed down a little, looked,\u201d and saw that the police\n\n\u201cwere flying up\u201d toward them again. He proceeded through the intersection, with the two police\n\ncars still pursuing him. The pursuit continued in this manner, with three to five police cars\n\neventually joining the original two. The defendant drove as fast as 35 miles per hour on the side\n\nstreets. Near VanHoorebeke\u2019s house, the defendant tried to let VanHoorebeke off the motorcycle,\n\nfor her safety\u2019s sake. He slowed considerably, but he could not stop because the police were too\n\nclose and moving too fast. \u201cThey were right on me. *** The entire time.\u201d During this whole\n\npursuit, one or another police car came within one foot of the motorcycle on several occasions.\n\nAlso, at least one police car had its siren and flashing lights on. The defendant finally decided to\n\n\u201cput the bike down\u201d at the hospital. As for his driver\u2019s license, the defendant did not know that it\n\nwas suspended that day, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the honest to God\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18   For its rebuttal case, the State recalled David Morris. Essentially, Morris testified that\n\nduring his pursuit of the defendant\u2019s motorcycle, he never drove across anyone\u2019s lawn, and the\n\ndefendant had numerous opportunities to stop safely. Morris denied that he ever had displayed a\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fgun while searching for the defendant, but he stated that he had chased the defendant on foot on\n\ntwo prior occasions, without success. Morris did not recognize the motorcycle\u2019s driver as the\n\ndefendant until after he was placed under arrest near the hospital.\n\n\u00b6 19   The jury returned verdicts finding the defendant guilty as charged. That is, the jury found\n\nhim guilty of aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer and of driving while driver\u2019s\n\nlicense suspended.\n\n\u00b6 20   In August 2018, the defendant filed a pro se document captioned, \u201cIssues I\u2019d Like to Raise\n\non Record, for Purpose of Securing My Rights on Appeal.\u201d In that document, the defendant\n\ndiscussed a wide variety of issues relating to pretrial and trial proceedings, including claims of\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel.    (The court apparently viewed that document as an\n\nexpression of the defendant\u2019s desire for an appeal; the court did not consider the document a\n\nposttrial motion, and never mentioned the document until well after the defendant\u2019s sentencing.)\n\n\u00b6 21   On August 29, 2018, and September 12, 2018, the court held a sentencing hearing. The\n\npresentence investigation report, upon which the court relied, showed that the defendant had an\n\nextensive criminal record dating back to 1990, when the defendant was convicted of burglary and\n\ntwo battery charges in three separate case files from Cook County, Illinois. The defendant\n\nprovided the only live testimony at the sentencing hearing, describing the circumstances of his\n\nrecent dismissal from a drug-rehabilitation program, and his potential for rehabilitation generally.\n\nThe State pointed out that the defendant, at the time he committed the two instant offenses, was\n\non pretrial release in two unrelated Saline County felony cases. The State also presented certified\n\ncopies of the defendant\u2019s convictions in four felony cases from Franklin County, Illinois. These\n\nincluded a conviction for aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony, in case No. 06-CF-221, for which\n\nthe defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6\u00bd years. In the instant case, the circuit\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fcourt sentenced the defendant as follows: for aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police\n\nofficer, imprisonment for an extended term of five years, plus one year of MSR, and for driving\n\nwhile driver\u2019s license suspended, 364 days of incarceration, concurrent with the prison sentence.\n\n\u00b6 22   In October 2018, the defendant simultaneously filed, pro se, a motion to reduce sentence\n\nand a notice of appeal. In November 2018, the defendant\u2019s appointed attorney on appeal, OSAD,\n\nfiled in this court a motion to dismiss the appeal as premature. This court granted the motion to\n\ndismiss the appeal.\n\n\u00b6 23   With the case back before the circuit court, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was granted leave\n\nto withdraw. The court appointed a new posttrial attorney.\n\n\u00b6 24   In March 2019, the new posttrial attorney filed, on behalf of the defendant, a motion for a\n\nnew trial and a motion to reconsider sentence. In the former motion, the defendant claimed that\n\nvarious specified errors by the trial court and trial counsel had deprived him of a fair trial. In the\n\nlatter motion, he alleged that his sentence was excessive, and that the sentencing court ignored\n\nmitigating factors.\n\n\u00b6 25   In April 2019, the defendant filed a handwritten pro se document describing a wide variety\n\nof alleged errors by trial counsel, the trial prosecutor, and the trial court. In May 2019, the\n\ndefendant filed a handwritten pro se document captioned, \u201cIssues to be Raised and Placed on\n\nRecord for Preserving Appeal Rights.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26   In June 2019, the defendant, by posttrial counsel, filed a \u201cfirst amended motion for new\n\ntrial.\u201d This first amended motion included all of the claims found in the original motion filed in\n\nMarch 2019, plus a few more claims that the defendant personally wanted to include, for a grand\n\ntotal of 28 claims. (More information about these 28 claims will be presented in the analysis\n\nportion of this order, infra.) The State filed a written response to the first amended motion.\n\n\n                                                  9\n\f\u00b6 27   On July 2, 2019, the court held a hearing on the \u201cfirst amended motion for a new trial,\u201d\n\nfiled in June 2019, and the motion to reduce sentence, filed in March 2019. Posttrial counsel\n\ninformed the court that all of the defendant\u2019s pro se claims had been incorporated into the first\n\namended motion for new trial. No witnesses testified at this hearing. Defense counsel briefly\n\nargued in favor of a few of the claims presented in his first amended motion for a new trial.\n\nSpecifically, counsel argued (1) that the court erred in failing to definitively state, prior to the\n\ncommencement of the defendant\u2019s trial, whether the defendant was eligible for extended-term\n\nsentencing; (2) that the trial court erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance\n\nof the trial; (3) that the trial court erred in allowing evidence that the defendant had active warrants\n\nat the time of the offenses; (4) that the trial court erred in denying the defense motion for a directed\n\nverdict; (5) that trial counsel had failed to attempt to contact a defense witness, Jennifer\n\nQuertermous; and (6) that trial counsel had failed to cross-examine police officer David Morris\n\nabout \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d between his trial testimony and his written police report, such as his location\n\nwhen he first contacted dispatch, and the defendant\u2019s wearing or not wearing safety glasses. As\n\nfor all the other claims in the first amended motion for a new trial, defense counsel stood on the\n\nmotion. The defendant personally argued that portions of Morris\u2019s testimony were simply not\n\ncredible. At the hearing\u2019s end, the court took the matters under advisement.\n\n\u00b6 28    On July 31, 2019, in a docket-entry order, the court denied both the first amended motion\n\nfor a new trial and the motion to reduce sentence. According to the court, every one of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s claims was \u201cfactually inaccurate and or lacks legal merit.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29    In August 2019, the defendant filed, by counsel, a notice of appeal, thus perfecting the\n\ninstant appeal. The circuit court appointed OSAD to represent the defendant on appeal. OSAD\n\nsubsequently filed an amended notice of appeal.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f\u00b6 30                                     ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 31    This appeal is from a judgment of conviction. As previously mentioned, the defendant\u2019s\n\nappointed attorney on appeal, OSAD, has concluded that this appeal lacks merit, and accordingly\n\nit has filed an Anders motion to withdraw as counsel. This court agrees with OSAD\u2019s assessment\n\nof this appeal. Therefore, OSAD\u2019s Anders motion must be granted, and the judgment of conviction\n\nmust be affirmed.\n\n\u00b6 32    In the brief that accompanies the Anders motion, OSAD addresses four potential issues on\n\nappeal. They are (1) whether the State failed to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt; (2) whether any sentencing considerations are still justiciable in light of the fact that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s sentence, including his term of MSR, has expired; (3) whether trial counsel provided\n\nineffective assistance; and (4) whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial by any of the\n\nseveral errors that he alleged the trial court and the State had committed. This court addresses\n\nthese potential issues in turn.\n\n\u00b6 33    The first potential issue presented by OSAD is whether the State proved the defendant\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, the State bears the burden of proving a defendant guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const., amend.

They were (1) aggravated\n\nfleeing or attempting to elude a police officer (625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4) (West 2016)) and\n\n(2) driving while driver\u2019s license suspended (625 ILCS 5/6-303(a) (West 2016)).\n\n\u00b6 35      As to the first of these two offenses, the aggravated-fleeing count, the court properly\n\ninstructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty, it had to find that five propositions\n\nhad been proved, viz.: (1) that the defendant was the driver or operator of a motor vehicle; (2) that\n\nthe defendant was given a visual or audible signal by a police officer directing him to bring his\n\nvehicle to a stop; (3) that the peace officer was in police uniform, and, if the officer was driving a\n\nvehicle, that the vehicle displayed illuminated, oscillating, rotating, or flashing red or blue lights,\n\nwhich when used in conjunction with an audible horn or siren, would indicate the vehicle to be an\n\nofficial police vehicle; (4) that the defendant willfully failed or refused to obey such signal in order\n\nto flee or attempt to elude the officer; and (5) that such flight or attempt to elude by the defendant\n\ninvolved disobedience of two or more traffic control devices. Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions,\n\nCriminal, No. 23.02, modified; 625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4) (West 2016).                The State\u2019s two\n\nwitnesses, police officers Morris and Leverett, provided abundant testimony on each of these five\n\npropositions.    Moreover, the defendant\u2014or his witness, Alberta VanHoorebeke\u2014essentially\n\nadmitted to these five propositions (except for the one about the police officers being in uniform).\n\nFor example, the defendant testified that he thought the police wanted him to pull over his\n\nmotorcycle, and that he saw flashing lights, and heard a siren, from at least one of the police cars\n\nthat followed him.\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f\u00b6 36   The defendant sought to defend himself against this aggravated-fleeing charge by asserting\n\nthat his actions were necessary to avoid a wreck. Thus, the defendant\u2019s defense added a sixth\n\nelement to the offense\u2014\u201c[t]hat the defendant did not act out of necessity.\u201d Illinois Pattern Jury\n\nInstructions, Criminal, No. 24-25.22A. The jury was so instructed. The definition of necessity\n\nwas also given to the jury. It read:\n\n       \u201cConduct which would otherwise be an offense is justifiable by reason of necessity if the\n\n       defendant was without blame in occasioning or developing the situation and reasonably\n\n       believed that such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than\n\n       the injury which might reasonably result from his own conduct.\u201d Illinois Pattern Jury\n\n       Instructions, Criminal, No. 24-25.22; 720 ILCS 5/7-13 (West 2016).\n\nIt is no wonder that a necessity defense was unsuccessful. Everyone who testified at the trial,\n\nwhether for the State or for the defense, made clear that the defendant had plenty of opportunity\n\nto pull over; he did not need to take the officers on this ridiculous chase that endangered everyone\n\non the road that evening, including his passenger on the motorcycle. Even the defendant testified\n\nthat when the police first turned around on Granger Street and attempted to stop him, the defendant\n\n\u201cmade a right [onto West College Street], pulled over on the side of the road right there.\u201d He\n\nshould have remained on the side of the road. If he had, this entire chase could have been avoided.\n\nA rational trier of fact certainly could have found the essential elements of aggravated fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer, and found them beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u00b6 37   As to the second of the defendant\u2019s two offenses, i.e., driving while driver\u2019s license\n\nsuspended, the State had no difficulty in proving its two elements\u2014(1) that the defendant was\n\ndriving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on any highway of this state, and (2) that\n\nhis driver\u2019s license was suspended at the time. 625 ILCS 5/6-303(a) (West 2016). The defendant\n\n\n                                                13\n\fadmitted to the two elements, and the State produced a certified copy of the driving abstract from\n\nthe Illinois Secretary of State showing that his license was indeed suspended on October 3, 2016.\n\nThe fact that the defendant was unaware of the suspension at the time he drove makes no difference\n\nfor this absolute-liability offense. See People v. Espenscheid, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">109 Ill. App. 2d 107</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1969)\n\n(\u201cmental state\u201d is not involved in the offense of driving while driver\u2019s license suspended).\n\n\u00b6 38   In short, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, on both charges, was overwhelming. It was\n\nas close as real life comes to being an open-and-shut case.\n\n\u00b6 39   The second potential issue presented by OSAD is whether any sentencing considerations\n\nare still justiciable in light of the fact that the defendant\u2019s sentence, including his term of MSR,\n\nhas been completed. In the \u201cfirst amended motion for new trial,\u201d the defendant alleged that he was\n\nnot given sufficient notice that he was subject to an extended term. In the motion to reconsider\n\nsentence, he alleged that his sentence was excessive in light of mitigating factors. However, as\n\nthe website of the Illinois Department of Corrections (DOC) seems to suggest, and as OSAD\u2019s and\n\nthis court\u2019s calculations make perfectly clear, the defendant has completed his entire sentence,\n\nincluding the term of MSR. The defendant\u2019s name does not appear in the DOC\u2019s inmate-search\n\ndatabase, suggesting that he has completed MSR. It was on September 12, 2018, that the court\n\nsentenced the defendant to an extended term of imprisonment of five years for aggravated fleeing\n\nor attempting to elude a police officer, to be followed by one year of MSR, and 364 days for driving\n\nwhile driver\u2019s license suspended, concurrent with the aggravated-fleeing sentence. He received\n\ncredit for 494 days of presentence incarceration, and he was eligible for day-for-day good-conduct\n\ncredit. See 730 ILCS 5/3-6-3(a)(2.1) (West 2016) (except for enumerated offenses, prisoner shall\n\nreceive \u201cone day of sentence credit for each day of his or her sentence of imprisonment\u201d). Taking\n\neverything into account, the defendant would have finished his year of MSR in early November\n\n\n                                                14\n\f2020, more than 1\u00bd years ago. \u201cSince the sentence has been served, the question of the validity\n\nof its imposition is moot, and it is unnecessary for this court to consider it further.\u201d People v.\n\nMurrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2096709\"><a href=\"/opinion/2096709/people-v-murrell/\">60 Ill. 2d 287</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (1975).\n\n\u00b6 40   Even if the sentencing issues were not moot, they are meritless. For example, his claim\n\nthat he was not eligible for extended-term sentencing for aggravated fleeing, a Class 4 felony, is\n\nmeritless due to his prior conviction for aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony, in Franklin County\n\ncase No. 06-CF-221, a crime for which he was sentenced to 6\u00bd years of imprisonment. See 730\n\nILCS 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 2016) (reasons to impose an extended-term sentence). (OSAD wrote\n\nthat the defendant was extended-term eligible by virtue of his Class 3 felony conviction in Franklin\n\nCounty case No. 07-CF-387. However, the trial prosecutor, during a discussion just prior to\n\nvoir dire, indicated that that particular conviction had been reversed on appeal.)\n\n\u00b6 41   The third potential issue presented by OSAD is whether trial counsel provided ineffective\n\nassistance. Generally, when a defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, he must make\n\ntwo separate showings: (1) that counsel\u2019s assistance was deficient, i.e., that it fell below an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that there is a reasonable likelihood that counsel\u2019s\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant, so that the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different. Strickland v.

Griffin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230043\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230043/people-v-griffin/\">178 Ill. 2d 65</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (1997).\n\n\u00b6 42    The defendant and posttrial counsel raised several claims of ineffective assistance by trial\n\ncounsel. In its Anders brief, OSAD specifically mentions that trial counsel (1) failed to subpoena\n\nand call a witness named Jennifer Quertermous, who would have \u201cimpeached\u201d the testimony of\n\nState\u2019s witness Morris, (2) failed to subpoena dash camera footage, (3) failed to subpoena a police\n\nlog to see which officers were working that night, (4) failed to show him the discovery, (5) failed\n\nto investigate his issues, and (6) failed to determine whether College Street was two-way after\n\nschool hours. However, OSAD then states that \u201cthe claims about discovery, which evidence to\n\nsubpoena, which witnesses to call, and which witnesses to investigate are all undermined by the\n\nfact that, according to what [trial counsel] told the judge in open court, [the defendant] was a no-\n\ncall/no-show at three separate meetings [counsel] had scheduled for them prior to trial, on June 11,\n\nJuly 2, and July 17, 2018.\u201d It is true that trial counsel told the judge that the defendant had failed\n\nto appear for meetings on those dates, and that the purpose of those meetings was, in trial counsel\u2019s\n\nwords, \u201cto try to make sure that [the defendant] was competently represented, that we could present\n\na defense\u201d including \u201cwitnesses [the defendant] may want to call.\u201d As OSAD comments, \u201c[the\n\ndefendant] alleges several failures by [trial counsel], but the failure is really [the defendant\u2019s]\n\nfailure to show up to the meetings at which he and [defense counsel] were supposed to accomplish\n\nthe very things [the defendant] is now complaining did not get done.\u201d Certainly, the defendant did\n\nnot dispute that his attorney had scheduled those meetings or that he himself had failed to attend\n\nthem.\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f\u00b6 43   Moreover, as OSAD also states, the defendant cannot show prejudice from any of these\n\nalleged failures by counsel. Indeed, he failed to show prejudice when he had the opportunity to\n\nshow it in the circuit court. The defendant certainly cannot expect a reviewing court to divine the\n\nprejudice visited upon him by trial counsel\u2019s supposed errors. As discussed supra, the combined\n\ntestimonies of the defendant and of defense witness VanHoorebeke served to provide (essentially)\n\nall of the evidence needed to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is\n\nno reasonable probability that the trial\u2019s result would have been any different if trial counsel had\n\nperformed differently.\n\n\u00b6 44   The fourth potential issue presented by OSAD is whether the defendant was deprived of a\n\nfair trial by any of the several errors that he alleged the trial court and the State had committed.\n\nThe defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying a directed verdict, in not allowing the\n\njury to hear the directed verdict motion and ruling, and in allowing evidence that the defendant\n\nhad active warrants at the time he fled police on October 3, 2016. The defendant claimed that the\n\nState erred in telling witness VanHoorebeke to stop looking at the defendant and asking her\n\nwhether she was afraid of the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 45   When deciding a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court determines only whether a\n\nreasonable mind could fairly conclude the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, while\n\nconsidering the evidence most strongly in the State\u2019s favor. In moving for a directed verdict, the\n\ndefendant admits the truth of the facts stated in the State\u2019s evidence, for purposes of the motion.\n\nPeople v. Aljohani, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 IL App (1st) 190692</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 78. Without question, once you admit the truth\n\nof the trial testimonies of Morris and Leverett, plus the certified driving abstract, a reasonable mind\n\ncould fairly conclude that the defendant was guilty of both charges against him, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Also, there is no absolute right to make any argument at all on a motion for\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fdirected verdict. People v. Withers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2147034\"><a href=\"/opinion/2147034/people-v-withers/\">87 Ill. 2d 224</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 230-31 (1981). Given that there is no right to\n\nargue, there cannot be a right to have the jury hear that argument. Additionally, the motion for\n\ndirected verdict is a purely legal matter, entirely within the purview of the trial court; there is\n\nnothing for the jury to do regarding such a motion. There was no error in the court\u2019s denying the\n\ndefendant\u2019s directed-verdict motion, or in the manner in which the court denied it. (Frankly, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine why the defendant would have wanted the jury to hear his motion for a directed\n\nverdict and the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion. The jury may have viewed the ruling as the\n\ncircuit court\u2019s endorsement of the defendant\u2019s guilt.)\n\n\u00b6 46   There also was no error in allowing the State to present evidence that the defendant had\n\noutstanding \u201cwarrants for [his] arrest\u201d at the time he fled from the police. Although \u201c[e]vidence\n\nof other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person,\u201d such evidence\n\nmay be admissible for \u201cother purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Ill. R. Evid. 404(b) (eff. Jan. 1,\n\n2011). In the instant case, evidence that the defendant had outstanding warrants against him was\n\nadmissible for the purpose of proving his motive for fleeing the police. The defendant testified\n\nthat he had sped away from the officers in order to avoid a wreck and injury to his passenger. The\n\nState was permitted to present evidence of a very different motive\u2014to escape an arrest on\n\noutstanding warrants. (That is especially the case where the evidence did not even mention the\n\ncrimes\u2014aggravated battery and unlawful possession of a converted license plate\u2014for which the\n\ndefendant was wanted, thus minimizing prejudice to the defendant.)\n\n\u00b6 47   Also, there was no error in the State\u2019s telling witness VanHoorebeke to stop looking at the\n\ndefendant and asking her whether she was afraid of the defendant. \u201c[A] trial court can generally\n\ncorrect any error resulting from an improper remark by sustaining an objection or instructing the\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fjury to disregard the statement.\u201d People v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">343 Ill. App. 3d 110</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116 (2003). In this case,\n\nwhen the State made the statement and asked the question that it did, trial counsel for the defendant\n\ninterposed an objection. The trial court then chided the State, stating that witness VanHoorebeke\n\nwas free to look at the defendant. \u201cIf you think [the defendant] is doing something inappropriate,\n\nyou can bring that to the Court\u2019s attention. She can look at me. She can look at you. She can look\n\nat the jury. So that objection will be sustained.\u201d Given the strength of the evidence against the\n\ndefendant\u2014evidence from both the State\u2019s witnesses, and the defendant and his witness\u2014there is\n\nnothing to the argument that this limited episode deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\n\n\u00b6 48   As for the remainder of the issues presented in the \u201cfirst amended motion for new trial,\u201d\n\nand the motion to reconsider sentence, they are, in the words of OSAD, \u201cirrelevant, wholly\n\nconclusory, or rebutted by the record.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 49   An example of an irrelevant claim is the defendant\u2019s argument that he could not be guilty\n\nof driving while license suspended because he never had a motorcycle license. However, \u201cdriver\u2019s\n\nlicense\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny license to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of this State.\u201d\n\n625 ILCS 5/1-116.1 (West 2016). Whether his license had an \u201cM\u201d classification permitting him\n\nto drive a motorcycle is irrelevant.\n\n\u00b6 50   Examples of wholly conclusory claims are the defendant\u2019s claims that \u201c[t]he manner of\n\njury selection was improper,\u201d \u201d[t]he manner of arraignment was improper,\u201d \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s\n\nright to speedy trial was violated,\u201d \u201c[t]he state engaged in malicious prosecution,\u201d \u201c[t]he\n\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights were violated,\u201d and portions of the testimonies of State\u2019s witnesses\n\nMorris and Leverett were \u201cirrelevant, immaterial, and/or too prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d None\n\nof those claims was accompanied by any specifics at all. A defendant must state \u201cspecific grounds\n\nfor objection\u201d if he wants to preserve an issue for appeal. People v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">219 Ill. App. 3d 949</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f951 (1991). \u201c[M]erely vague, general allegations of error in a posttrial motion are insufficient to\n\npreserve a claim for appeal\u201d and will result in \u201cthe waiver of the issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\n\nomitted.) People v. Lenz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019 IL App (2d) 180124</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 79. The defendant\u2019s wholly conclusory\n\narguments are waived. Also, there was no contemporaneous objection relating to Morris\u2019s or\n\nLeverett\u2019s testimony, or to the manner of jury selection, so those issues are waived for that reason\n\ntoo. See People v. McLaurin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169359\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169359/people-v-mclaurin/\">235 Ill. 2d 478</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (2009) (\u201cto preserve a claim of error for review,\n\ncounsel must object to the error at trial and raise the error in a motion for a new trial before the\n\ntrial court\u201d). In addition, this court cannot identify anything at all improper or erroneous in any of\n\nthese matters.\n\n\u00b6 51   Finally, some of the defendant\u2019s claims are flat-out rebutted by the record. For example,\n\nthe defendant claimed that the jury \u201cheard\u201d his trial attorney comment that he feared the defendant\n\nmight punch him in the face. As this court has noted, supra, the jury was not in the room at the\n\ntime the comment was made; there is no reason to imagine that the jury heard the prejudicial\n\ncomment.\n\n\u00b6 52                                   CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 53   For all of the reasons stated above, this appeal has no merit whatsoever.

Defendant\n\nhad to break off the fight when he felt a seizure beginning and left the camp. In the\n\nmeantime, his tent-mate and one-time codefendant, Jesus Renteria, attacked the victim\n\nwith a knife, inflicting multiple serious wounds. When defendant returned to the camp,\n\nhe saw a piece of carpet covering the victim where he lay on the ground. Defendant\n\nobtained a firearm from his tent and shot the victim in the head, claiming he did so to put\n\nthe victim out of his misery, although he thought the victim was dead. After a trial, the\n\njury returned verdicts convicting defendant of first-degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187,\n\nsubd. (a))1 and finding that in the commission of the murder defendant personally and\n\nintentionally discharged a firearm causing the death of the victim (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)).\n\nDefendant was sentenced to state prison for an aggregate term of 50 years to life and\n\nappealed.\n\n       On appeal, defendant argues that (1) his due process rights were violated by the\n\ntrial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on a theory of heat of passion voluntary\n\nmanslaughter; (2) the court erred in imposing the minimum restitution fine and other fees\n\nand assessments without determining if defendant had an ability to pay; and (3) the term\n\nimposed for the gun discharge enhancement must be remanded to allow the court to\n\nexercise discretion to consider a lesser included enhancement.

The\n\nPeople agree that the matter should be remanded to the superior court to allow that court\n\nto exercise its discretion to either strike or impose a lesser included enhancement. We\n\ntherefore reverse the sentence and otherwise affirm.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n       Defendant and his girlfriend, Cricket, lived in a tent with Jesus Renteria in a tight-\n\nknit homeless camp along the Santa Ana River in Riverside. Defendant was acquainted\n\nwith victim Michael Carmona, known as \u201cBear,\u201d and had fought with him on occasion.\n\n       In June 2016, defendant and Carmona started fighting after Carmona pushed\n\nCricket down and struck her, after kicking Cricket\u2019s dog. Defendant and Carmona\n\nwrestled for 15 or 20 minutes, until defendant felt he was going to have a seizure and let\n\ngo of Carmona to go down to the river. When he left, \u201cColt\u201d intervened and administered\n\na choke hold until Carmona lost consciousness.\n\n       A short time later, when Carmona regained consciousness, Renteria went into a\n\ntent, came out with a knife and proceeded to stab Carmona multiple times. When the\n\nstabbing stopped, Carmona emitted gargling and gasping sounds and appeared to be\n\ndying. Renteria handed the knife to another camp resident, Peter Strother, who had\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fobserved the stabbing, and left. Strother put the knife in a container inside his tent, to\n\nkeep it for investigators. After Renteria left, Strother could hear Carmona breathing.\n\nDefendant returned to the camp, where Strother was waiting, carrying a rifle. Defendant\n\nwalked up to the victim, whose face was covered with a carpet, and pulled the trigger,\n\nafter which Strother saw and heard no further movement or breathing from the victim.\n\n       On June 18, 2016, law enforcement officers found Carmona in a shallow grave\n\napproximately 25 feet from defendant\u2019s tent, with the assistance of a cadaver-sniffing\n\ndog. The body was still wrapped in carpet. Officers also discovered a .22 caliber bolt-\n\naction single-shot rifle in defendant\u2019s tent, and they recovered the knife and a .22 caliber\n\ncasing from Strother\u2019s tent.\n\n       By the time Carmona\u2019s body was found, it was already moderately decomposed.\n\nThe pathologist noted several knife wounds, but not all of them did major damage. One\n\nwound punctured the victim\u2019s lung, and another pierced the lower chest and upper\n\nabdomen, either of which could have eventually killed the victim within a matter of\n\nminutes.\n\n       In addition, there was a gunshot wound to the victim\u2019s head, which fractured the\n\nskull from the inside. The bullet, which did not exit the skull, was found inside the brain.\n\nThe bullet wound would have caused death immediately. Any of the three major wounds\n\ncould have killed the victim, but death would have occurred over an interval of minutes.\n\n       The ultimate cause of death was attributed to homicidal violence, meaning there\n\nwas more than one type of violent act. The pathologist could not say for certain, based\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fon the decomposition of the body, that the victim was alive when the bullet entered his\n\nbrain.\n\n         Defendant was charged with murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)) along with an enhancement\n\nallegation that he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily\n\ninjury and death within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (d). He was tried\n\nby a jury, where defendant testified in his own defense.\n\n         According to defendant, when he felt a seizure coming on, he went down to the\n\nriver, and while there he heard Renteria say, \u201cOh s\u2014t, he\u2019s dead\u201d or \u201cOh s\u2014t, he\u2019s\n\ngone.\u201d Approximately 10 minutes later, defendant returned to the camp, where he saw\n\nCarmona lying on his back, covered in blood, and not breathing. Carmona was wrapped\n\nin a carpet. Defendant knew he was not breathing because he put his hands in front of the\n\nvictim\u2019s nose to check for breathing. Carmona was not moving at all or making any\n\nnoise. Defendant then went into his tent to get his gun, walked over to Carmona and shot\n\nhim. By this time, Carmona\u2019s head was covered.\n\n         Defendant explained he shot Carmona because he thought the brain could still feel\n\npain, likening the situation to when a chicken is decapitated, and defendant wanted to put\n\nCarmona at ease. He denied telling officers that Carmona was moving, although he\n\nrecalled telling them that he saw movement that he thought was Carmona\u2019s nerves\n\nsettling. He explained that when he told police he might have seen movement, he did not\n\nreally see movement, but was just freaking out. He was sure Carmona was dead. Later,\n\ndefendant buried the victim.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f          On rebuttal, Detective Cobb referred to defendant\u2019s interview, taped at the station,\n\nin which defendant denied any involvement in the homicide until being confronted with\n\nstatements of other witnesses. Defendant never told the detective anything about\n\nthinking that dead people feel pain, but, instead, told the detective he was putting\n\nCarmona out of his misery after acknowledging there was movement on the part of the\n\nvictim.\n\n          Defendant was convicted as charged of first-degree murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)), and\n\nthe jury also returned a true finding that defendant discharged a firearm in the\n\ncommission of the murder. On August 3, 2018, the court sentenced defendant to state\n\nprison for an aggregate term of 50 years to life, comprised of a term of 25 years to life for\n\nthe first-degree murder, as well as 25 years to life for the gun discharge enhancement.\n\n          In addition, the court ordered defendant to pay victim restitution in the amount of\n\n$925.00 pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f), along with $300, the minimum\n\nrestitution fine, pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (b), and a $300 parole-revocation\n\nrestitution fine, which was suspended unless parole is revoked, pursuant to section\n\n1202.45, subdivision (c). The court also imposed a criminal conviction assessment fee of\n\n$30 pursuant to Government Code section 70373, and an operations assessment in the\n\namount of $40, pursuant to Penal Code, section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1). On January\n\n14, 2019, the court modified the sentence, finding defendant lacked the ability to pay the\n\nbooking fee, the fee for preparation of the probation report, or the presentence\n\nincarceration costs, staying the imposition of those amounts.\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       Defendant timely appealed. On May 20, 2020, we affirmed the conviction and\n\nsentence in a partially published opinion. (Formerly at People v. Valles (2020) 49 Cal.\n\nApp. 5th 156.) Defendant filed a petition for review which was granted and held pending\n\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Tirado, supra, 12 Cal 5th 68. Following the\n\nissuance of that opinion, the Supreme Court retransferred the case to this court with\n\ndirections to vacate our decision and reconsider it in light of its holding in Tirado.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n       1.     The Trial Court Was Not Required to Instruct on Heat of Passion Voluntary\n\nManslaughter.\n\n       Background\n\n       Defendant requested instructions on voluntary manslaughter based on sudden\n\nquarrel or heat of passion as a lesser offense of murder. The trial court concluded there\n\nwas no viable theory for voluntary manslaughter because of all the breaks in time and\n\nbecause defendant\u2019s own testimony was completely contrary to a theory of sudden\n\nquarrel, heat of passion. The court subsequently instructed the jury on first- and second-\n\ndegree murder, as well as involuntary manslaughter.\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred in concluding there was \u201cno viable theory\n\nfor voluntary manslaughter\u201d and in failing to instruct on the lesser included offense.\n\nSpecifically, he claims that the failure to instruct on manslaughter constitutes federal\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fconstitutional error because it relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove malice\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.\n\n       Legal Principles\n\n       On appeal, we review independently the question whether the trial court\n\nimproperly failed to instruct on a lesser included offense. (People v. Souza (2012) 54\n\nCal.4th 90, 113.)\n\n       \u201c\u2018It is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial court\n\nmust instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the\n\nevidence. [Citations.] The general principles of law governing the case are those\n\nprinciples closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are\n\nnecessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the case.\u2019\u201d (People v. Breverman (1998) 19\n\nCal.4th 142, 154, quoting People v. St. Martin (1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 531.)\n\n       The obligation to instruct on general principles includes the duty to give\n\ninstructions on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether\n\nall elements of the charged offense were present, but not when there is no evidence that\n\nthe offense was less than that charged. (People v. Breverman, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p.\n\n154, citing People v Hood (1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 449-450; People v. Noah (1971) 5 Cal.3d\n\n469, 479; People v. Osuna (1969) 70 Cal.2d 759, 767.) \u201cSuch instructions [on lesser\n\nincluded offenses] are required when, but only when, a jury could reasonably conclude\n\nthat the defendant committed the lesser offense but not the greater one.\u201d (People v.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fHardy (2018) 5 Cal.5th 56, 98, citing People v. Breverman, supra, 19 Cal.4th at pp. 161-\n\n162.)\n\n        Voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder. (People v. Duff\n\n(2014) 58 Cal.4th 527, 561.) \u201cHeat of passion, which likewise reduces murder to\n\nvoluntary manslaughter, arises when the defendant is provoked by acts that would \u2018render\n\nan ordinary person of average disposition \u201cliable to act rashly or without due deliberation\n\nand reflection, and from this passion rather than from judgement\u2019\u201d [citation], and kills\n\nwhile under the actual influence of such a passion [citation].\u201d (Id. at p. 562.)\n\n        A defendant must actually be motivated by passion in committing the killing.\n\n(People v. Beltran (2013) 56 Cal.4th 935, 951.) \u201c\u2018[I]f sufficient time has elapsed\n\nbetween the provocation and the fatal blow for passion to subside and reason to return,\n\nthe killing is not voluntary manslaughter. . . . \u2019\u201d (Beltran, supra, at p. 951, citing People\n\nv. Wickersham (1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 327, disapproved on another ground in People v.\n\nBarton (1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201.)\n\n        Here, the evidence is uncontradicted that after wrestling with the victim (over the\n\nvictim\u2019s assault on defendant\u2019s girlfriend) for several minutes, defendant went down to\n\nthe river because he felt a seizure coming on. By his own testimony, he was down at the\n\nriver for about 20 to 30 minutes before returning to the camp. In the meantime, he had\n\nheard Renteria say either that \u201che\u2019s dead\u201d or \u201che\u2019s gone,\u201d and when defendant returned to\n\nthe camp 10 minutes after hearing that statement, he saw the victim lying helpless on the\n\nground, covered with blood and not breathing. Defendant did not testify that he was still\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fupset or angry over the victim\u2019s assault on defendant\u2019s girlfriend, nor did he testify that\n\nhe felt threatened by the victim.\n\n       While defendant described feeling \u201cfreaked out\u201d when he told police investigating\n\nthe crime that he had seen movement on the part of the victim as he lay on the ground, he\n\ndid not describe any passion that would render an ordinary person of average disposition\n\n\u201cliable to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection,\u201d and killing under the\n\ninfluence of that passion. He certainly did not describe his actions at the time of the\n\nshooting as having been performed under heat of passion as he entered his tent to get his\n\ngun, and then returned to the victim to shoot him in the head. He had cooled off.\n\n       By a parity of reasoning, defendant could not rely on the victim\u2019s earlier assault on\n\ndefendant\u2019s girlfriend as creating sufficient anger to mitigate the crime, warranting a\n\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction, where the victim-aggressor had been rendered\n\nhelpless before defendant returned to the camp and went for his gun. In any event,\n\ndefendant\u2019s testimony, and his pretrial statements to police, that he shot the victim to put\n\nhim out of his misery, precludes any notion that he was motivated by any desire to defend\n\nhis girlfriend, or because he was \u201cfreaked out,\u201d when he obtained his rifle from his tent\n\nand then shot the helpless (and either dying or dead) victim in the head.\n\n       To suggest that defendant\u2019s actions were comparable to those of an ordinary\n\nperson of average disposition is unreasonable. An ordinary person of average\n\ndisposition, upon seeing a stabbing victim bleeding on the ground, does not get a rifle to\n\nfinish him off. The average person of ordinary disposition would seek emergency\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fassistance for the victim, or so we hope. The fact that the defendant did not seek\n\nemergency assistance for the victim, and, instead, procured a rifle to put him out of his\n\nmisery, speaks volumes about defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting. He\n\nintended to make sure the victim was dead.\n\n       Thus, the only evidence of defendant\u2019s mental state was that of premeditation and\n\ndeliberation when he entered his tent, obtained the firearm, returned to where the victim\n\nlay, and shot him in the head. There is no evidence that the offense was less than that\n\ncharged. (People v. Breverman, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 154.) There was no error in\n\nrefusing to instruct the jury on the theory of heat of passion voluntary manslaughter.\n\n       2.     The Trial Court Properly Considered Defendant\u2019s Inability to Pay in\n\nOrdering the Minimum Restitution Fine.\n\n       Defendant argues that the $300 restitution and parole revocation restitution fines\n\n(\u00a7\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b), 1202.45), the $40 court operations fee (\u00a7 1465.8), and the $30\n\ncourt facilities fee (Govt. Code, \u00a7 70373) must be vacated because the imposition of\n\nthose fees violated his due process rights.\n\n       Defendant acknowledges that the court did make a finding that he lacked ability to\n\npay for the preparation of the probation report, the booking fee, and the presentence\n\nincarceration costs; he also acknowledges that he failed to object to the imposition of the\n\nrestitution fines. Nevertheless, relying on People v. Due\u00f1as (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1157\n\n(Due\u00f1as), he argues that the court improperly imposed the additional fines and fees. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       Restitution Fines\n\n       We begin by noting that while Due\u00f1as and other recent decisions have treated\n\nrestitution fines as comparable to the various fees imposed for court operations, probation\n\nreport preparation and court facilities fees, they are not equivalent, and must be treated\n\ndifferently. The imposition of a restitution fine is punishment. (People v. Allen (2019)\n\n41 Cal.App.5th 312, 321, citing People v. Guillen (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 975, 984.)\n\nCourt fees are not. (People v. Alford (2007) 42 Cal.4th 749, 757; see also People v.\n\nKnightbent (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1112.) Because the restitution fine is intended\n\nas punishment, it is subject to challenge under the excessive fines clause of the Eighth\n\nAmendment of the federal Constitution and article I, section 17 of the California\n\nConstitution. However, the trial court\u2019s authority to consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay\n\nis limited.\n\n       It has long been held that the law mandates the sentencing court to impose a\n\nrestitution fine of at least the statutory minimum and is not required to make a finding of\n\na defendant\u2019s ability to pay before imposing the statutory minimum fine. (\u00a7 1202.4,\n\nsubd. (c); People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 729.) In fact, the statute expressly states\n\nthat inability to pay is not a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a\n\nrestitution fine. (\u00a71202.4, subd. (c).) Because the court imposed the statutory minimum\n\nrestitution fine, no ability to pay hearing was required. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (d); People v.\n\nWall (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1048, 1076, citing People v. Covarrubias (2016) 1 Cal.5th 838,\n\n935-936.)\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f         An ability-to-pay hearing is required only where the court imposes a restitution\n\nfine exceeding the statutory minimum. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (c); In re Enrique Z. (1994) 30\n\nCal.App.4th 464, 468-469.) As the trial court is not required to make express findings\n\nconcerning a defendant\u2019s ability to pay a restitution fine, the absence of findings does not\n\ndemonstrate it failed to consider this factor. (People v. Nelson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 198,\n\n227, citing People v. Gamache (2010) 48 Cal.4th 347, 409.) We disagree with the\n\nconclusion that there is a due process requirement that the court hold an ability to pay\n\nhearing before imposing a minimum restitution fine.\n\n         Additionally, defendant has forfeited any objection to the imposition of the\n\nrestitution fine and the parole revocation restitution fine by failing to object at the\n\nsentencing hearing. (People v. Gamache, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 409; People v. Jenkins\n\n(2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 30, 40; People v. Forshay (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 686, 689; People\n\nv. Gibson (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1468-1469.)\n\n         The decision in Due\u00f1as broke with longstanding precedent in requiring the court\n\nto consider ability to pay before imposing the statutory minimum restitution fine and\n\npermitting an appellate challenge to the fine absent an objection in the trial court. The\n\ndecision also ignores precedents holding that section 1203.4 presumes a defendant has\n\nthe ability to pay the fine (People v. DeFrance (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 486, 505, citing\n\nPeople v. Romero (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 440, 448), and that the court is not required to\n\nmake express findings on that issue. (People v. Hennessey (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1830,\n\n1836.)\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       Subsequent to the Due\u00f1as decision, on September 18, 2020, the Governor signed\n\nAssembly Bill No. 1869. Effective July 1, 2021, Assembly Bill No. 1869 \u201celiminate[d]\n\nthe range of administrative fees that agencies and courts are authorized to impose to fund\n\nelements of the criminal legal system and . . . eliminate[d] all outstanding debt incurred\n\nas a result of the imposition of [identified] administrative fees.\u201d (Stats. 2020, ch. 92, \u00a7 2;\n\nPeople v. Greeley (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 609, 625.)\n\n       Respecting restitution fines, the Legislature did not substantively modify section\n\n1202.4 in the 2021 amendments. Section 1202.4 continues to mandate imposition of\n\nrestitution fines of at least $300, unless compelling reasons were found by the trial court\n\nand stated on the record. Effective January 1, 2022, the statute still requires a trial court\n\nto impose a restitution fine, unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not\n\ndoing so and states those reasons on the record. It further provides that the restitution\n\nfine shall be set at the discretion of the court and commensurate with the seriousness of\n\nthe offense, and, if the defendant has been convicted of a felony, the fine shall not be less\n\nthan three hundred dollars ($300). (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1), added by Stats. 2021 ch 257\n\n\u00a719 (AB 177), effective September 23, 2021, operative January 1, 2022.)\n\n       Under well-settled rules of statutory construction, \u201c\u2018\u201c[t]here is a strong\n\npresumption that when the Legislature reenacts a statute which has been judicially\n\nconstrued it adopts the construction placed on the statute by the courts.\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\n\nThat is because, [w]hen the Legislature amends a statute without changing those\n\nportions . . . that have previously been construed by the courts, the Legislature is\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fpresumed to have known of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial\n\nconstruction.\u2019\u201d [Citation.]\u201d (Sharon S. v. Superior Court (2003) 31 Cal 4th 417, 433-\n\n434.)) Thus, imposition of the minimum restitution find was mandatory in the absence of\n\ncompelling reasons stated on the record.\n\n       We therefore decline to follow Due\u00f1as as it pertains to the imposition of a\n\nstatutorily minimum restitution fine.\n\n       Court Facilities Fee\n\n       As for the court facilities fee pursuant to Government Code, section 70373, the\n\nissue was not forfeited by defendant\u2019s failure to object, and may be reviewed pursuant to\n\nDue\u00f1as.2 (See People v. Johnson (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 134, 138; but see People v.\n\nFrandsen, supra, 33 Cal.App.5th at p. 1153.) However, that does not mean remand is\n\nrequired.\n\n       The record does not establish that defendant has a present inability to pay. While\n\nhe was homeless at the time of the offense, and has since been committed to state prison,\n\nthis circumstance does not necessarily establish an inability to pay absent evidence he is\n\nineligible for prison work programs. (See People v. Gamache, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p.\n\n409.) A court may consider a defendant\u2019s ability to earn prison wages in determining\n\nability to pay. (People v. Jones (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 1028, 1035.)\n\n\n\n\n       2 Government Code section 70373, governs assessments imposed respecting\nfines. Although amended in 2021 (Stats. 2021, ch. 79, Assm. Bill No. 143), no\nsubstantive changes were made.\n\n                                            15\n\f       As defendant will be serving a lengthy prison sentence and the amount of the fees\n\nis small, it is appropriate for the court to consider the wages that he may earn in prison.\n\n(See People v. Hennessey (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1830, 1837 [ability to pay includes a\n\ndefendant\u2019s ability to obtain prison wages]; \u00a7 2085.5 [outlining how a restitution fine\n\nbalance may be collected from prison wages].) Absent evidence defendant is not eligible\n\nfor work while committed to state prison, he has not met his burden of establishing his\n\ninability to pay. (See People v. Jones (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 1028, 1035.)\n\n       Nevertheless, because defendant\u2019s case will be remanded for resentencing\n\npursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in People v. Tirado, supra, 12 Cal.5th\n\n688 (see Issue No. 3, post), the trial court may also reconsider the fines and fees imposed.\n\n(See People v. Buycks (2018) 5 Cal.5th 857, 893; see also People v. Nilsson (2015) 242\n\nCal.App.4th 1, 34 [full resentencing includes consideration of fines, fees, and\n\nrestitution].)\n\n       Thus, while remand is unnecessary, the trial court may reconsider its decision in\n\nresentencing defendant.\n\n       3.        The Matter Should be Remanded to the Trial Court to Consider Whether to\n\nStrike or Impose the Gun Discharge Enhancement, or Whether to Impose a Lesser\n\nIncluded Enhancement..\n\n       At trial, the jury made a true finding on the gun discharge enhancement allegation\n\npursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). In supplemental briefing in the original\n\nappeal, defendant argued that the gun discharge enhancement pursuant to section\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f12022.53, subdivision (d), must be reversed and remanded because the trial court did not\n\nunderstand that the extent of its discretion included the discretion to impose a lesser\n\nenhancement pursuant to either section 12022.53, subdivision (b) or (c). At that time, the\n\nPeople argued the issue was forfeited by defendant\u2019s failure to request that the trial court\n\nexercise its discretion respecting the enhancement.\n\n       Also at that time, the Supreme Court was considering this issue in People v.\n\nTirado. That opinion has now issued, resulting in the Supreme Court\u2019s order vacating\n\nour opinion with directions that we reconsider the issue in light of the new precedent.\n\n       Prior to 2017, section 12022.53, subdivision (h), prohibited the trial court from\n\nstriking an allegation under the section or a finding bringing a person within the\n\nprovisions of the section, notwithstanding section 1385. (Former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (h).)\n\nHowever, in 2017, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill 620 (Stats. 2017, ch. 682 \u00a7 2, pp.\n\n5104-5106, eff. Jan. 1, 2018, amending \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5 and 12022.53). The Legislative\n\nCounsel\u2019s Digest explains that SB 620 \u201cwould delete the prohibition on striking an\n\nallegation or finding and, instead, would allow a court, in the interest of justice and at the\n\ntime of sentencing or resentencing, to strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise\n\nrequired to be imposed . . . .\u201d\n\n       Notably, both the current and former versions of subdivision (h) of section\n\n12022.53 referred to a trial court\u2019s discretion to dismiss or strike pursuant to section\n\n1385. The power to dismiss an action includes the power to dismiss or strike an\n\nenhancement. (People v. Thomas (1992) 4 Cal.4th 206, 209; People v. Luckett (1996) 48\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fCal.App.4th 1214, 1218.) As a consequence, prior to the decision in Tirado, courts have\n\ntreated the court\u2019s authority pursuant to section 1385 to be binary and, based on the state\n\nof the law at the time, in the original appeal we held that the power to dismiss or strike\n\ndoes not necessarily include a broad discretion to impose a lesser enhancement. We\n\nreasoned that the power to dismiss or strike did not necessarily include a broad discretion\n\nto impose a lesser enhancement, noting that nothing in the language of section 1385, nor\n\nin the cases interpreting the trial court\u2019s discretionary authority, refers to a court\u2019s\n\ndiscretion to impose a lesser enhancement, except \u201cwhen a greater enhancement found\n\ntrue by the trier of fact is either legally inapplicable or unsupported by sufficient\n\nevidence.\u201d (People v.

(People v. Morrison, supra, 34 Cal.App.5th at p. 222.) With the split of\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fauthority among the appellate districts, the Supreme Court granted review in People v.\n\nTirado, supra, formerly at (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 637, 644, review granted Nov. 13,\n\n2019, S257658 [no change in publication status per Cal.

Birks (1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 134.\n\n       In Tirado, the Supreme Court agreed that Morrison correctly described the scope\n\nof the trial court\u2019s discretion pursuant to section 12022.53. (Tirado, supra, 12 Cal.5th at\n\np. 697.) The court agreed that it is the prosecution that determines what charges should\n\nbe brought and against whom. (Id., at p. 702, citing Birks, supra, 19 Cal.4th at pp. 134\u2013\n\n135.) It also acknowledged that the prosecutorial prerogative \u201cincludes the power to\n\ncharge specific enhancements and seek the maximum available term [citation] free from\n\njudicial supervision or interference.\u201d (Tirado, supra, at p. 702)\n\n       However, the Supreme Court held that \u201conce those decisions have been made and\n\nthe proceedings have begun, \u2018the process which leads to acquittal or to sentencing is\n\nfundamentally judicial in nature.\u2019 [Citation.] The prosecution cannot control the court\u2019s\n\nauthority to select from the legislatively authorized sentencing options.\u201d [Citation.]\u201d\n\n(Tirado, supra,12 Cal.5th at p. 702.)\n\n       In light of the holding in Tirado, the People agree that remand for resentencing is\n\nappropriate, to give the superior court the opportunity to exercise its sentencing\n\ndiscretion. Nothing we have stated in this opinion is intended to direct the superior court\n\nto exercise its discretion in any particular manner.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f                                                  III.\n\n                                           DISPOSITION\n\n       The sentence is reversed and remanded to the superior court for resentencing, at\n\nwhich hearing the trial court may exercise its discretion to strike the gun discharge\n\nenhancement or to impose a lesser included enhancement, or to reimpose the\n\nenhancement as found true by the jury.

Defendant was acquainted\n\nwith victim Michael Carmona, known as \u201cBear,\u201d and had fought with him on occasion.\n\n       In June 2016, defendant and Carmona started fighting after Carmona pushed\n\nCricket down and struck her, after kicking Cricket\u2019s dog. Defendant and Carmona\n\nwrestled for 15 or 20 minutes, until defendant felt he was going to have a seizure and let\n\ngo of Carmona to go down to the river. When he left, \u201cColt\u201d intervened and administered\n\na choke hold until Carmona lost consciousness.\n\n       A short time later, when Carmona regained consciousness, Renteria went into a\n\ntent, came out with a knife and proceeded to stab Carmona multiple times. When the\n\nstabbing stopped, Carmona emitted gargling and gasping sounds and appeared to be\n\ndying. Renteria handed the knife to another camp resident, Peter Strother, who had\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fobserved the stabbing, and left. Strother put the knife in a container inside his tent, to\n\nkeep it for investigators. After Renteria left, Strother could hear Carmona breathing.\n\nDefendant returned to the camp, where Strother was waiting, carrying a rifle. Defendant\n\nwalked up to the victim, whose face was covered with a carpet, and pulled the trigger,\n\nafter which Strother saw and heard no further movement or breathing from the victim.\n\n       On June 18, 2016, law enforcement officers found Carmona in a shallow grave\n\napproximately 25 feet from defendant\u2019s tent, with the assistance of a cadaver-sniffing\n\ndog. The body was still wrapped in carpet. Officers also discovered a .22 caliber bolt-\n\naction single-shot rifle in defendant\u2019s tent, and they recovered the knife and a .22 caliber\n\ncasing from Strother\u2019s tent.\n\n       By the time Carmona\u2019s body was found, it was already moderately decomposed.\n\nThe pathologist noted several knife wounds, but not all of them did major damage. One\n\nwound punctured the victim\u2019s lung, and another pierced the lower chest and upper\n\nabdomen, either of which could have eventually killed the victim within a matter of\n\nminutes.\n\n       In addition, there was a gunshot wound to the victim\u2019s head, which fractured the\n\nskull from the inside. The bullet, which did not exit the skull, was found inside the brain.\n\nThe bullet wound would have caused death immediately. Any of the three major wounds\n\ncould have killed the victim, but death would have occurred over an interval of minutes.\n\n       The ultimate cause of death was attributed to homicidal violence, meaning there\n\nwas more than one type of violent act. The pathologist could not say for certain, based\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fon the decomposition of the body, that the victim was alive when the bullet entered his\n\nbrain.\n\n         Defendant was charged with murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)) along with an enhancement\n\nallegation that he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily\n\ninjury and death within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (d). He was tried\n\nby a jury, where defendant testified in his own defense.\n\n         According to defendant, when he felt a seizure coming on, he went down to the\n\nriver, and while there he heard Renteria say, \u201cOh s\u2014t, he\u2019s dead\u201d or \u201cOh s\u2014t, he\u2019s\n\ngone.\u201d Approximately 10 minutes later, defendant returned to the camp, where he saw\n\nCarmona lying on his back, covered in blood, and not breathing. Carmona was wrapped\n\nin a carpet. Defendant knew he was not breathing because he put his hands in front of the\n\nvictim\u2019s nose to check for breathing. Carmona was not moving at all or making any\n\nnoise. Defendant then went into his tent to get his gun, walked over to Carmona and shot\n\nhim. By this time, Carmona\u2019s head was covered.\n\n         Defendant explained he shot Carmona because he thought the brain could still feel\n\npain, likening the situation to when a chicken is decapitated, and defendant wanted to put\n\nCarmona at ease. He denied telling officers that Carmona was moving, although he\n\nrecalled telling them that he saw movement that he thought was Carmona\u2019s nerves\n\nsettling. He explained that when he told police he might have seen movement, he did not\n\nreally see movement, but was just freaking out. He was sure Carmona was dead. Later,\n\ndefendant buried the victim.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f          On rebuttal, Detective Cobb referred to defendant\u2019s interview, taped at the station,\n\nin which defendant denied any involvement in the homicide until being confronted with\n\nstatements of other witnesses. Defendant never told the detective anything about\n\nthinking that dead people feel pain, but, instead, told the detective he was putting\n\nCarmona out of his misery after acknowledging there was movement on the part of the\n\nvictim.\n\n          Defendant was convicted as charged of first-degree murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)), and\n\nthe jury also returned a true finding that defendant discharged a firearm in the\n\ncommission of the murder. On August 3, 2018, the court sentenced defendant to state\n\nprison for an aggregate term of 50 years to life, comprised of a term of 25 years to life for\n\nthe first-degree murder, as well as 25 years to life for the gun discharge enhancement.\n\n          In addition, the court ordered defendant to pay victim restitution in the amount of\n\n$925.00 pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f), along with $300, the minimum\n\nrestitution fine, pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (b), and a $300 parole-revocation\n\nrestitution fine, which was suspended unless parole is revoked, pursuant to section\n\n1202.45, subdivision (c). The court also imposed a criminal conviction assessment fee of\n\n$30 pursuant to Government Code section 70373, and an operations assessment in the\n\namount of $40, pursuant to Penal Code, section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1). On January\n\n14, 2019, the court modified the sentence, finding defendant lacked the ability to pay the\n\nbooking fee, the fee for preparation of the probation report, or the presentence\n\nincarceration costs, staying the imposition of those amounts.\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       Defendant timely appealed. On May 20, 2020, we affirmed the conviction and\n\nsentence in a partially published opinion. (Formerly at People v.

Defendant filed a petition for review which was granted and held pending\n\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Tirado, supra, 12 Cal 5th 68. Following the\n\nissuance of that opinion, the Supreme Court retransferred the case to this court with\n\ndirections to vacate our decision and reconsider it in light of its holding in Tirado.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n       1.     The Trial Court Was Not Required to Instruct on Heat of Passion Voluntary\n\nManslaughter.\n\n       Background\n\n       Defendant requested instructions on voluntary manslaughter based on sudden\n\nquarrel or heat of passion as a lesser offense of murder. The trial court concluded there\n\nwas no viable theory for voluntary manslaughter because of all the breaks in time and\n\nbecause defendant\u2019s own testimony was completely contrary to a theory of sudden\n\nquarrel, heat of passion. The court subsequently instructed the jury on first- and second-\n\ndegree murder, as well as involuntary manslaughter.\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred in concluding there was \u201cno viable theory\n\nfor voluntary manslaughter\u201d and in failing to instruct on the lesser included offense.\n\nSpecifically, he claims that the failure to instruct on manslaughter constitutes federal\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fconstitutional error because it relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove malice\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.\n\n       Legal Principles\n\n       On appeal, we review independently the question whether the trial court\n\nimproperly failed to instruct on a lesser included offense. (People v. Souza (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">54\n\nCal.4th 90</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113.)\n\n       \u201c\u2018It is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial court\n\nmust instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the\n\nevidence. [Citations.] The general principles of law governing the case are those\n\nprinciples closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are\n\nnecessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the case.\u2019\u201d (People v.

By his own testimony, he was down at the\n\nriver for about 20 to 30 minutes before returning to the camp. In the meantime, he had\n\nheard Renteria say either that \u201che\u2019s dead\u201d or \u201che\u2019s gone,\u201d and when defendant returned to\n\nthe camp 10 minutes after hearing that statement, he saw the victim lying helpless on the\n\nground, covered with blood and not breathing. Defendant did not testify that he was still\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fupset or angry over the victim\u2019s assault on defendant\u2019s girlfriend, nor did he testify that\n\nhe felt threatened by the victim.\n\n       While defendant described feeling \u201cfreaked out\u201d when he told police investigating\n\nthe crime that he had seen movement on the part of the victim as he lay on the ground, he\n\ndid not describe any passion that would render an ordinary person of average disposition\n\n\u201cliable to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection,\u201d and killing under the\n\ninfluence of that passion. He certainly did not describe his actions at the time of the\n\nshooting as having been performed under heat of passion as he entered his tent to get his\n\ngun, and then returned to the victim to shoot him in the head. He had cooled off.\n\n       By a parity of reasoning, defendant could not rely on the victim\u2019s earlier assault on\n\ndefendant\u2019s girlfriend as creating sufficient anger to mitigate the crime, warranting a\n\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction, where the victim-aggressor had been rendered\n\nhelpless before defendant returned to the camp and went for his gun. In any event,\n\ndefendant\u2019s testimony, and his pretrial statements to police, that he shot the victim to put\n\nhim out of his misery, precludes any notion that he was motivated by any desire to defend\n\nhis girlfriend, or because he was \u201cfreaked out,\u201d when he obtained his rifle from his tent\n\nand then shot the helpless (and either dying or dead) victim in the head.\n\n       To suggest that defendant\u2019s actions were comparable to those of an ordinary\n\nperson of average disposition is unreasonable. An ordinary person of average\n\ndisposition, upon seeing a stabbing victim bleeding on the ground, does not get a rifle to\n\nfinish him off. The average person of ordinary disposition would seek emergency\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fassistance for the victim, or so we hope. The fact that the defendant did not seek\n\nemergency assistance for the victim, and, instead, procured a rifle to put him out of his\n\nmisery, speaks volumes about defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting. He\n\nintended to make sure the victim was dead.\n\n       Thus, the only evidence of defendant\u2019s mental state was that of premeditation and\n\ndeliberation when he entered his tent, obtained the firearm, returned to where the victim\n\nlay, and shot him in the head. There is no evidence that the offense was less than that\n\ncharged. (People v. Breverman, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 154.) There was no error in\n\nrefusing to instruct the jury on the theory of heat of passion voluntary manslaughter.\n\n       2.     The Trial Court Properly Considered Defendant\u2019s Inability to Pay in\n\nOrdering the Minimum Restitution Fine.\n\n       Defendant argues that the $300 restitution and parole revocation restitution fines\n\n(\u00a7\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b), 1202.45), the $40 court operations fee (\u00a7 1465.8), and the $30\n\ncourt facilities fee (Govt. Code, \u00a7 70373) must be vacated because the imposition of\n\nthose fees violated his due process rights.\n\n       Defendant acknowledges that the court did make a finding that he lacked ability to\n\npay for the preparation of the probation report, the booking fee, and the presentence\n\nincarceration costs; he also acknowledges that he failed to object to the imposition of the\n\nrestitution fines. Nevertheless, relying on People v. Due\u00f1as (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">30 Cal.App.5th 1157</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Due\u00f1as), he argues that the court improperly imposed the additional fines and fees. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       Restitution Fines\n\n       We begin by noting that while Due\u00f1as and other recent decisions have treated\n\nrestitution fines as comparable to the various fees imposed for court operations, probation\n\nreport preparation and court facilities fees, they are not equivalent, and must be treated\n\ndifferently. The imposition of a restitution fine is punishment. (People v. Allen (2019)\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">41 Cal.App.5th 312</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321, citing People v. Guillen (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">218 Cal.App.4th 975</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984.)\n\nCourt fees are not. (People v.

Because the restitution fine is intended\n\nas punishment, it is subject to challenge under the excessive fines clause of the Eighth\n\nAmendment of the federal Constitution and article I, section 17 of the California\n\nConstitution. However, the trial court\u2019s authority to consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay\n\nis limited.\n\n       It has long been held that the law mandates the sentencing court to impose a\n\nrestitution fine of at least the statutory minimum and is not required to make a finding of\n\na defendant\u2019s ability to pay before imposing the statutory minimum fine. (\u00a7 1202.4,\n\nsubd. (c); People v.

In fact, the statute expressly states\n\nthat inability to pay is not a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a\n\nrestitution fine. (\u00a71202.4, subd. (c).) Because the court imposed the statutory minimum\n\nrestitution fine, no ability to pay hearing was required. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd.

As the trial court is not required to make express findings\n\nconcerning a defendant\u2019s ability to pay a restitution fine, the absence of findings does not\n\ndemonstrate it failed to consider this factor. (People v. Nelson (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">51 Cal.4th 198</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n227, citing People v.

We disagree with the\n\nconclusion that there is a due process requirement that the court hold an ability to pay\n\nhearing before imposing a minimum restitution fine.\n\n         Additionally, defendant has forfeited any objection to the imposition of the\n\nrestitution fine and the parole revocation restitution fine by failing to object at the\n\nsentencing hearing. (People v. Gamache, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2523859\"><a href=\"/opinion/2523859/people-v-gamache/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 48 Cal.4th at p. 409; People v.

The\n\ndecision also ignores precedents holding that section 1203.4 presumes a defendant has\n\nthe ability to pay the fine (People v. DeFrance (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">167 Cal.App.4th 486</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505, citing\n\nPeople v. Romero (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">43 Cal.App.4th 440</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448), and that the court is not required to\n\nmake express findings on that issue. (People v. Hennessey (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">37 Cal.App.4th 1830</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1836.)\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       Subsequent to the Due\u00f1as decision, on September 18, 2020, the Governor signed\n\nAssembly Bill No. 1869.

Greeley (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">70 Cal.App.5th 609</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625.)\n\n       Respecting restitution fines, the Legislature did not substantively modify section\n\n1202.4 in the 2021 amendments. Section 1202.4 continues to mandate imposition of\n\nrestitution fines of at least $300, unless compelling reasons were found by the trial court\n\nand stated on the record. Effective January 1, 2022, the statute still requires a trial court\n\nto impose a restitution fine, unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not\n\ndoing so and states those reasons on the record. It further provides that the restitution\n\nfine shall be set at the discretion of the court and commensurate with the seriousness of\n\nthe offense, and, if the defendant has been convicted of a felony, the fine shall not be less\n\nthan three hundred dollars ($300). (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1), added by Stats. 2021 ch 257\n\n\u00a719 (AB 177), effective September 23, 2021, operative January 1, 2022.)\n\n       Under well-settled rules of statutory construction, \u201c\u2018\u201c[t]here is a strong\n\npresumption that when the Legislature reenacts a statute which has been judicially\n\nconstrued it adopts the construction placed on the statute by the courts.\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\n\nThat is because, [w]hen the Legislature amends a statute without changing those\n\nportions . . . that have previously been construed by the courts, the Legislature is\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fpresumed to have known of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial\n\nconstruction.\u2019\u201d [Citation.]\u201d (Sharon S. v. Superior Court (2003) 31 Cal 4th 417, 433-\n\n434.)) Thus, imposition of the minimum restitution find was mandatory in the absence of\n\ncompelling reasons stated on the record.\n\n       We therefore decline to follow Due\u00f1as as it pertains to the imposition of a\n\nstatutorily minimum restitution fine.\n\n       Court Facilities Fee\n\n       As for the court facilities fee pursuant to Government Code, section 70373, the\n\nissue was not forfeited by defendant\u2019s failure to object, and may be reviewed pursuant to\n\nDue\u00f1as.2 (See People v. Johnson (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">35 Cal.App.5th 134</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138; but see People v.\n\nFrandsen, supra, 33 Cal.App.5th at p. 1153.) However, that does not mean remand is\n\nrequired.\n\n       The record does not establish that defendant has a present inability to pay. While\n\nhe was homeless at the time of the offense, and has since been committed to state prison,\n\nthis circumstance does not necessarily establish an inability to pay absent evidence he is\n\nineligible for prison work programs. (See People v. Gamache, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2523859\"><a href=\"/opinion/2523859/people-v-gamache/\">supra,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 48 Cal.4th at p.\n\n409.) A court may consider a defendant\u2019s ability to earn prison wages in determining\n\nability to pay. (People v. Jones (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">36 Cal.App.5th 1028</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1035.)\n\n\n\n\n       2 Government Code section 70373, governs assessments imposed respecting\nfines. Although amended in 2021 (Stats. 2021, ch. 79, Assm.

Hennessey (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">37 Cal.App.4th 1830</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1837 [ability to pay includes a\n\ndefendant\u2019s ability to obtain prison wages]; \u00a7 2085.5 [outlining how a restitution fine\n\nbalance may be collected from prison wages].) Absent evidence defendant is not eligible\n\nfor work while committed to state prison, he has not met his burden of establishing his\n\ninability to pay. (See People v. Jones (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">36 Cal.App.5th 1028</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1035.)\n\n       Nevertheless, because defendant\u2019s case will be remanded for resentencing\n\npursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in People v. Tirado, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal.5th\n\n688</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (see Issue No. 3, post), the trial court may also reconsider the fines and fees imposed.\n\n(See People v.

The Matter Should be Remanded to the Trial Court to Consider Whether to\n\nStrike or Impose the Gun Discharge Enhancement, or Whether to Impose a Lesser\n\nIncluded Enhancement..\n\n       At trial, the jury made a true finding on the gun discharge enhancement allegation\n\npursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). In supplemental briefing in the original\n\nappeal, defendant argued that the gun discharge enhancement pursuant to section\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f12022.53, subdivision (d), must be reversed and remanded because the trial court did not\n\nunderstand that the extent of its discretion included the discretion to impose a lesser\n\nenhancement pursuant to either section 12022.53, subdivision (b) or (c). At that time, the\n\nPeople argued the issue was forfeited by defendant\u2019s failure to request that the trial court\n\nexercise its discretion respecting the enhancement.\n\n       Also at that time, the Supreme Court was considering this issue in People v.\n\nTirado. That opinion has now issued, resulting in the Supreme Court\u2019s order vacating\n\nour opinion with directions that we reconsider the issue in light of the new precedent.\n\n       Prior to 2017, section 12022.53, subdivision (h), prohibited the trial court from\n\nstriking an allegation under the section or a finding bringing a person within the\n\nprovisions of the section, notwithstanding section 1385. (Former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (h).)\n\nHowever, in 2017, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill 620 (Stats. 2017, ch. 682 \u00a7 2, pp.\n\n5104-5106, eff. Jan. 1, 2018, amending \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5 and 12022.53). The Legislative\n\nCounsel\u2019s Digest explains that SB 620 \u201cwould delete the prohibition on striking an\n\nallegation or finding and, instead, would allow a court, in the interest of justice and at the\n\ntime of sentencing or resentencing, to strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise\n\nrequired to be imposed . . . .\u201d\n\n       Notably, both the current and former versions of subdivision (h) of section\n\n12022.53 referred to a trial court\u2019s discretion to dismiss or strike pursuant to section\n\n1385. The power to dismiss an action includes the power to dismiss or strike an\n\nenhancement. (People v. Thomas (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.4th 206</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209; People v.

As a consequence, prior to the decision in Tirado, courts have\n\ntreated the court\u2019s authority pursuant to section 1385 to be binary and, based on the state\n\nof the law at the time, in the original appeal we held that the power to dismiss or strike\n\ndoes not necessarily include a broad discretion to impose a lesser enhancement. We\n\nreasoned that the power to dismiss or strike did not necessarily include a broad discretion\n\nto impose a lesser enhancement, noting that nothing in the language of section 1385, nor\n\nin the cases interpreting the trial court\u2019s discretionary authority, refers to a court\u2019s\n\ndiscretion to impose a lesser enhancement, except \u201cwhen a greater enhancement found\n\ntrue by the trier of fact is either legally inapplicable or unsupported by sufficient\n\nevidence.\u201d (People v.

The amended complaint alleges a\nviolation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Civ. Code,1 \u00a7 1750\net seq.) based on defendant\u2019s failure to disclose, prior to providing emergency\nmedical treatment, that its bill for emergency services would include an\nevaluation and management services fee (EMS Fee), by visibly posting\n\u201csignage in or around defendant\u2019s emergency rooms or at its registration\nwindows/desks.\u201d Plaintiff acknowledges that Division One of this court\nrecently held that identical allegations do not state a cause of action under\n\n\n\n\n       1   All statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fthe CLRA.

Following two successful\ndemurrers by defendant, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint (hereafter\ncomplaint) eliminating the causes of action for declaratory judgment and\nviolation of the UCL, and asserting a single cause of action for violation of\nsection 1770, subdivisions (a)(5) and (a)(14) of the CLRA.4\n\n\n\n\n      2 After briefing was complete, the Fifth Appellate District issued Torres\nv. Adventist Health System/West (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 500 affirming a\njudgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant hospital on an identical\nclaim, albeit on different grounds. (See fn. 8, post.)\n      3Plaintiff\u2019s opening brief indicates that his attorney, who also\nrepresented Gray, had filed a petition for review and request for\ndepublication of Gray with the California Supreme Court. Defendant\u2019s\nrequest that we take judicial notice of the January 26, 2022, order denying\nthat request is denied as unnecessary.\n      4  Section 1770 reads in relevant part: \u201c(a) The unfair methods of\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices listed in this subdivision\nundertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or that results\nin the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer are unlawful: [\u00b6] . . .\n[\u00b6] (5) Representing that goods or services have sponsorship, approval,\ncharacteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities that they do not\nhave or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation, or\nconnection that the person does not have.

His total\ncharges of $4,593 (before discounts) included the undisclosed EMS Fee in the\namount of $2,811. The complaint continues, \u201cPlaintiff is informed and\nbelieves and thereon alleges that, unlike other items billed to emergency\nroom patients, this [EMS Fee] is charged to emergency room patients simply\nfor seeking treatment in the emergency room and is designed to cover\n\u2018overhead\u2019 and general operating and staffing expenses for operating an\nemergency room on a 24 hour basis. It is not like other individual billable\nitems of treatment or services. Rather, it is . . . charged to every emergency\nroom patient who presents and is treated at any one of defendant\u2019s\nemergency rooms. Further, the fact that defendant intends to charge an EMS\nFee to patients simply for being seen in the emergency room is not visibly\nposted on signage in or around defendant\u2019s emergency rooms or at its\nregistration windows/desks, where a patient would at least have the\nopportunity of knowing of its existence . . . .\u201d Plaintiff alleges that patients\n\u201chave a right to know about [the EMS Fee], and defendant owed/owes\nplaintiff and class members a corresponding duty to notify them of such fee in\nadvance of providing treatment that triggers it.\u201d The complaint emphasizes,\n\u201cTo be clear, the signage that plaintiff would deem sufficient to notify\nprospective emergency room patients would be a simple, inexpensive matter,\nand would be of immense benefit to consumers, who would greatly benefit\nfrom a simple, prominent sign placed in defendant\u2019s emergency rooms.\u201d\n      California\u2019s \u201cPayers\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d Health and Safety Code\nsection 1339.50 et seq., sets forth obligations California hospitals owe to\nconsumers with respect to the pricing of medical services. Under the Payers\u2019\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fBill of Rights, California hospitals must publish on the hospital\u2019s website or\nat the hospital itself a \u201ccharge description master\u201d (chargemaster) listing the\nhospital\u2019s uniform charges for its services. (Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 1339.51,\nsubds. (a)(1), (b)(1)5; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-18(e) [Medicare participating\nhospitals must disclose, in addition to their chargemaster, a \u201clist\u201d of\n\u201cstandard charges\u201d in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services.]; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.60, subd.

In addition, the Payers\u2019 Bill of Rights requires the hospital to\n\u201cpost a clear and conspicuous notice in its emergency department\u201d informing\npatients that the chargemaster is available for review and how it may be\naccessed. (Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 1339.51, subd. (c).)\n      Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that defendant complies with the above\nrequirements by listing the EMS Fee in its chargemaster, which is published\non defendant\u2019s website. The complaint clarifies that plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cnot\nthat defendant fails to list an EMS Fee as a line item in its published\nchargemasters, or that defendant fails to list the price of such fees in its\nchargemasters.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) But, the complaint further alleges, \u201cthe\nrequirement for hospitals to post their chargemasters online . . . is not\n\n\n\n      5    Health and Safety Code section 1339.51, subdivisions (a) and (b) read\nin relevant part: \u201c(a) . . . a hospital . . . shall make a written or electronic copy\nof its charge description master available, either by posting an electronic copy\nof the charge description master on the hospital\u2019s Internet Website, or by\nmaking one written or electronic copy available at the hospital location.\n[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (b) For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall\napply: [\u00b6] (1) \u2018Charge description master\u2019 means a uniform schedule of\ncharges represented by the hospital as its gross billed charge for a given\nservice or item, regardless of payer type.\u201d\n\n\n                                         4\n\fintended to and does not inform emergency room patients of a hospital\u2019s\nintent to bill an [EMS] Fee for an emergency room visit, which is a matter\nthat is not addressed by the requirements for online posting of the\nchargemaster. The two issues, posting of a chargemaster, and notifying\nprospective emergency room patients of the intention to assess an [EMS] Fee,\nare completely separate and very distinct issues.\u201d\n      The trial court sustained the hospital\u2019s demurrer to the amended\ncomplaint without leave to amend, concluding that defendant has no duty to\npost notice of the EMS Fee in its emergency room. The trial court ruled that\nthe allegations of the complaint show that defendant has complied with its\nstatutory disclosure obligations and that there is no duty to make an\nadditional disclosure of the EMS Fee in light of the public policy reflected in\nfederal and state statutes that emergency room care be provided to patients\nwithout delay or questioning about their ability to pay. (See Health & Saf.\nCode, \u00a7 1317, subd. (d) [Hospitals must render emergency services \u201cwithout\nfirst questioning the patient or any other person as to his or her ability to pay\ntherefor.\u201d]; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(a) & (h) (Emergency Medical Treatment and\nActive Labor Act or EMTALA) [Medicare participating hospitals must\nprovide emergency services upon request and may not delay the provision of\nservices \u201cin order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or\ninsurance status.\u201d].)\n      Plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal from the subsequently entered\njudgment.\n                                  Discussion\n      \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018The [CLRA], enacted in 1970, \u201cestablished a nonexclusive statutory\nremedy for \u2018unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fwhich results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer. . . .\u2019\n[Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The self-declared purposes of the act are \u2018to protect\nconsumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide\nefficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Gray,\nsupra, 70 Cal.App.5th at pp. 242\u2013243.)\n      In Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at page 245, the court held that the\nplaintiff\u2019s assertion that the hospital failed to disclose, prior to providing\nmedical emergency treatment, that its billing for such treatment would\ninclude an emergency room charge (ER Charge) does not state a CLRA claim,\nunder section 1770, subdivision (a)(5) or (a)(14).6 In a well-reasoned opinion,\nthe court found that requiring such disclosure would be inconsistent with the\n\u201cstrong legislative policy\u201d reflected in the applicable \u201cmulti-faceted statutory\nand regulatory scheme\u201d designed \u201cto ensure that emergency medical care is\nprovided immediately to those who need it, and that billing disclosure\nrequirements are not to stand in the way of this paramount objective.\u201d (Id. at\np. 241, citing Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1317, subd. (d), 1339.51, subd. (c); 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395dd(a) & (h), 300gg-18(e); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.60, subd. (a)(1), 84\nFed.Reg. 65524-01 at p. 65564.) The court explained, \u201cNot only did [the\nhospital] fully comply with all state and federal disclosure requirements,\nincluding the requirement that there be signage in its emergency room\ndepartments stating how its pricing information can be accessed [citation],\nbut requiring individualized disclosure that the hospital will include an ER\nCharge in its emergency room billing, prior to providing any emergency\nmedical services, is at odds with the spirit, if not the letter, of the hospital\u2019s\nstatutory and regulatory obligations with respect to providing emergency\n\n\n      6There is no dispute that the \u201cER Charge\u201d referred to in Gray is the\nsame fee as the EMS Fee at issue in the present case.\n\n\n                                         6\n\fmedical care.\u201d (Id. at p. 240.) The court added, \u201cGray claims Dignity owes this\npretreatment disclosure duty in order to accomplish an objective antithetical\nto state and federal law\u2014to discourage some patients from remaining in the\nemergency room and receiving medical care. He asserts, for example, that if\nsignage were posted\u2014identifying the cost of each of the five levels of ER\nCharges (ranging from $984 to $7,356), each level accompanied by a one-word\ndescriptor (ranging from \u2018minor\u2019 to \u2018complex/life-threatening\u2019), with a caveat\nthat these are \u2018gross\u2019 charges prior to insurance and any other reduction and\n\u2018[y]our . . . costs may be substantially less\u2019\u2014this would be \u2018particularly\nbeneficial\u2019 to patients with \u2018relatively minor ailments\u2019 and go a long way\ntowards making emergency departments \u2018less crowded.\u2019 Even if lessening the\nload on our emergency rooms might be a laudable goal, Gray\u2019s sweeping\nassumption that those seeking care at an emergency department can\naccurately diagnose whether their ailment is \u2018relatively minor\u2019 and whether\nthey can safely transport themselves or be transported to a lower acuity\nfacility, is unsupportable. And while Gray complains this is a \u2018paternalistic\u2019\nattitude and asserts every person has a right to decide for him or herself\nwhether to seek medical treatment at an emergency department, and to do so\nbased on readily accessible cost information, this disregards the long\nstanding regulatory environment within which emergency departments\noperate, which emphasizes that no one in need of emergency care should be\ndeterred from receiving it because of its cost.\u201d (Id. at pp. 241\u2013242.)7\n\n\n      7 The court also held that the same allegations failed to state a cause of\naction under section 1170, subdivision (a)(14). (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 245.) The court explained, \u201cGray does not allege any collateral oral\nmisrepresentation by Dignity that is at odds with the terms of the hospital\u2019s\n[conditions of admission (COA)]. Nor does he allege that Dignity\u2019s COA\ncontains any term prohibited by law. The only allegation Gray makes with\n\n\n                                        7\n\f      We agree defendant does not have a duty under the CLRA to disclose\nthe EMS Fee by posting additional signage in its emergency rooms. As\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint acknowledges, the EMS Fee is disclosed in the hospital\u2019s\nchargemaster in compliance with state and federal law. Making the\nunsupported assumption that this disclosure is insufficient and does not in\nfact convey the necessary information to one seeking this information before\nreceiving emergency room treatment, there nonetheless is no basis to require\nfurther disclosure. Courts have \u201cidentified four situations in which a failure\nto disclose a fact constitutes a deceptive practice actionable under the CLRA.\n[Citation.] Those situations arise when the defendant is the plaintiff\u2019s\nfiduciary, when the defendant has exclusive knowledge of material facts not\nknown or reasonably accessible to the plaintiff, and when the defendant\nactively conceals a material fact. In addition, the duty to disclose exists \u2018when\nthe defendant makes partial representations that are misleading because\nsome other material fact has not been disclosed.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . In other\nwords, a defendant has a duty to disclose when the fact is known to the\ndefendant and the failure to disclose it is \u2018 \u201cmisleading in light of other facts\n. . . that [the defendant] did disclose.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto\nSuperstores California (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1234, 1258 (Gutierrez).) The\nexistence of a duty to disclose under the CLRA presents a legal question\nsubject to our de novo review. (Ibid.)\n\n\n\nrespect to the hospital\u2019s COA is that \u2018under Hospital\u2019s Contract,\u2019 he is\nassertedly \u2018not required to pay\u2019 the \u2018undisclosed\u2019 ER Charge. At most, he has\nalleged a breach of contract, which, alone, is not sufficient to state a claim\nunder Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(14).\u201d (Ibid.) Here, plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint does not include any allegations regarding defendant\u2019s COA. His\ncontention that he can amend the complaint to add such allegations and a\ncause of action for breach of contract is addressed post.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      Plaintiff argues that defendant had a duty to disclose under the CLRA\nbased on its \u201cexclusive knowledge\u201d and \u201cintentional concealment\u201d as alleged\nin his complaint. In this regard, plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that defendant\nhad \u201cexclusive knowledge that it would be billing plaintiff and class members\nsuch an [EMS] Fee;\u201d that \u201cthis fact was not known or reasonably accessible to\nplaintiff or class members at the time of their emergency room visits\u201d; that\n\u201c[s]uch charges are effectively hidden by defendant\u2019s intentional failure to\nprovide notice of them in its emergency rooms;\u201d and that \u201cdefendant\nintentionally conceals such fees.\u201d\n      In sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer, the trial court acknowledged that\ndefendant \u201chad a duty to disclose medical care fees generally\u201d based on its\n\u201cexclusive knowledge of material facts not known or reasonably accessible to\nthe plaintiff,\u201d but concluded that defendant did not have an additional duty\nto disclose the EMS Fee in the manner alleged in the complaint. We agree\nwith the trial court\u2019s reasoning. The hospital has a duty under the CLRA, as\nwell as the many statutes cited above, to disclose the fees it intends to charge\nfor its goods and services, including the EMS Fee. It does so in its\nchargemaster, to which signage in the emergency room directs those\ninterested.8 The question here, however, is whether defendant has a duty to\n\n\n      8 In Torres v. Adventist Health System/West, supra, 77Cal.App.5th at\npage 513, the court held that the hospital\u2019s compliance with the statutory\ndisclosure standards, including publication of its chargemaster, did not\nestablish that plaintiff had reasonable access to the material facts about its\nEMS Fee. Relying on allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint that the\nhospital\u2019s \u201cchargemaster was \u2018unusable and effectively worthless for the\npurpose of providing pricing information to consumers\u2019; the chargemaster\nfailed to include the standardized [current procedural terminology] codes\nrecognized in the industry; and the chargemaster used coding and highly\nabbreviated descriptions that are meaningless to consumers\u201d (id. at p. 512),\n\n\n                                       9\n\fcall attention to the EMS Fee by additional signage in the emergency room\nvisible to a person seeking emergency care. The Gray court concluded that for\nthe reasons it explained no such duty exists, and we agree.\n      Plaintiff faults the Gray decision for failing to distinguish between\ndiscouraging treatment by questioning patients as to their \u201cability to pay\u201d for\nthe treatment and merely providing information about the cost of treatment\nso that the patient can make an informed decision. He argues that neither\nthe letter nor purpose of the state and federal statutes \u201cis to require a\nhospital to withhold pricing information or fail to inform the patient as to the\nhospital\u2019s intent to assess an [EMS] Fee for their emergency room visit.\u201d But\nthere is no withholding of information that is provided on the hospital\u2019s\nchargemaster.\n      Moreover, the court in Gray carefully considered the competing\ninterests served by ensuring that patients are fully apprised in advance of\nthe costs of emergency services and ensuring that patients have timely access\n\n\nthe court reasoned that it could not \u201cconclude as a matter of law that an\nobjectively reasonable person who reviewed Hospital\u2019s chargemaster . . .\ncould discern the circumstances in which the EMS Fee is charged or how the\namount of the EMS Fee is determined\u201d (id. at p. 513). We need not reach this\nissue, however, as plaintiff\u2019s complaint expressly disavows any claim that\n\u201cdefendant fails to list an EMS Fee as a line item in its published\nchargemasters, or that defendant fails to list the price of such fees in its\nchargemasters.\u201d Moreover, the chargemaster is required to be filed annually\nwith the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (Health &\nSaf. Code, \u00a7 1339.55, subd. (a)) and that department is charged with\ninvestigating claims alleging a violation of the statute and requiring\ncorrective action. (Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 1339.54 [\u201cAny person may file a\nclaim with the department alleging a violation of this article. The department\nshall investigate and inform the complaining person of its determination\nwhether a violation has occurred and what action it will take.\u201d].) Accordingly,\nwe do not imply that defendant\u2019s chargemaster provides insufficient notice of\nthe existence of the EMS Fee.\n\n\n                                       10\n\fto emergency services. The court observed, \u201cIt is also telling that in\nexpanding the pricing disclosure obligations of hospitals under the [Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act (Pub.L. No. 111-148 (Mar. 23, 2010) 124\nStat. 119) (Affordable Care Act)], federal regulators took care to ensure that\nthese new obligations do not interfere with the emergency treatment\nobligations under the EMTALA. As we have discussed, the new pricing\ndisclosure requirements are focused on \u2018shoppable\u2019 medical services, that is,\nservices that can be scheduled in advance and, by definition, are not\nemergency medical services. Thus, the new pricing information is to be posted\non-line in a readily accessible format for use by consumers planning for\nscheduled medical treatment. People seek emergency medical treatment, in\ncontrast, for serious, and often grave, unplanned accidents or medical\ncalamities.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 241.) The court also cited\nlegislative history showing that \u201cwhen concern was raised that the new\nfederal disclosure requirements [under the Affordable Care Act] might\ninterfere with a hospital\u2019s obligations under the EMTALA\u2014including\nproviding emergency treatment to any person who seeks it and providing\nsuch treatment before any discussion about ability to pay\u2014the [Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services] stated, \u2018the price transparency provisions . . .\ndo not require that hospitals post any signage or make any statement at the\nemergency department regarding the cost of emergency care or any hospital\npolicies regarding prepayment of fees or payment of co-pays and deductibles.\n[Citation.] And while the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] lauded\nhospitals that go beyond posting the new pricing information, the efforts it\nidentified were post-treatment financial counseling and workable payment\nstrategies.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 241.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f      Plaintiff cites to additional legislative history suggesting that the\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services has considered whether hospitals\nshould make public standard charges and \u201coffer consumers opportunities for\ninformed decision-making by providing them with information about the cost\nof care which, for example, they might consider prior to visiting a hospital\nemergency department for treatment of a non-life threatening condition.\u201d\n(Citing 84 Fed.Reg. 65524-01 at p. 65536.) But, as Gray makes clear, the\nstate and federal legislative bodies are in a superior position to balance these\ncompeting interests and have done so in crafting the applicable \u201cmultifaceted\nstatutory and regulatory scheme.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 241.)\nOur conclusion is consistent with the balance struck by the existing\nregulatory scheme and does not, as plaintiff suggests, disregard the\n\u201cimportant policy in favor of providing pricing transparency to medical\npatients.\u201d\n      This reasoning applies with equal force to the alleged omission under\nsection 1770, subdivision (a)(14). Plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not distinguish\nbetween alleged omissions with respect to the \u201cservices and/or supplies\u201d it\nprovides and omission regarding the \u201ctransaction\u201d between it and plaintiff.9\n\n\n\n\n      9 Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges, \u201cAt all relevant times, defendant violated\nthe CLRA by engaging in and continuing to engage in deceptive practices,\nunlawful methods of competition, and/or unfair acts to the detriment of\nplaintiff and the class, including, but not limited to, the following: [\u00b6] (a) In\nviolation of Civil Code section 1770(a)(5), which applies in the context of\nomissions as well as affirmative misrepresentations, defendant\u2019s acts and\npractices constitute omissions/concealment that the services and/or supplies\nin question had characteristics, uses and/or benefits which they did not have;\nand [\u00b6] (b) In violation of Civil Code section 1770(a)(14), which also applies in\nthe context of omissions as well as affirmative misrepresentations, defendant\nomits/conceals that a transaction involves obligations which it does have.\u201d\n\n\n                                       12\n\f      Plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments that Gray was wrongly decided also\nlack merit. Initially, plaintiff argues that Gray is inapposite because it\nprimarily addresses Gray\u2019s claims under the UCL. While much of the\nanalysis quoted above is found within the court\u2019s discussion of Gray\u2019s claim\nunder the UCL (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at pp. 240\u2013242), the court then\nconcluded, with respect to Gray\u2019s CRLA claims, that \u201c[f]or all the reasons we\nhave discussed in connection with Gray's \u2018unfair\u2019 business practice claim,\nDignity did not owe Gray the duty he claims was owed in this case\u2014to\ndisclose, prior to providing any medical emergency treatment, that its billing\nfor such treatment would include an ER Charge.\u201d (Id. at p. 244.)\n      Plaintiff also argues that the Gray decision incorrectly relies on Nolte v.\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401 because the facility\nfee at issue in Nolte is distinguishable from the EMS Fee and ER Charge at\nissue here and in Gray. In Nolte, the court held that the plaintiff failed to\nstate a cause of action under the UCL based on allegations Cedars-Sinai had\nnot \u201cspecifically, separately, and individually disclose[d]\u201d an administrative\ncharge prior to the plaintiff receiving services from a physician at a hospital\nmedical facility. (Id. at p. 1408.) The court explained that Nolte\u2019s complaint\ndid \u201cnot allege (and the law does not provide) that Nolte had the right to have\nevery individual charge specifically disclosed to him in advance before Cedars\nissued a bill. Cedars\u2019s obligation to Nolte and other consumers of medical\nservices was that Cedars make a written or electronic copy of its schedule of\ncharges available in the manner codified in section 1339.51 of the Health and\nSafety Code, and there is no allegation that Cedars did not do so. Further,\n\u2018there is no requirement [under the UCL] that reasonable notice has to be the\nbest possible notice.\u2019 \u201d (Nolte, at p. 1409.) The court in Gray found that Nolte\nwas analogous and agreed with its holding. (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\fp. 238.) Although plaintiff here is correct that the \u201cfacility fee\u201d at issue in\nNolte is different from the fee at issue in Gray and the present case, the\nsituation nonetheless remains analogous. As the court in Gray explained,\n\u201cThis is essentially the same claim Gray advances here\u2014that, prior to\nproviding any emergency medical services, Dignity is required to disclose that\nits billing for such services will include an ER Charge. The factual\ndistinctions to which Gray points are immaterial.\u201d (Gray, at p. 240.) We agree\nthat Nolte is analogous and well-reasoned.\n      Plaintiff contends the court in Gray improperly implied a \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nfor the hospital\u2019s alleged omission. In Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v.\nLos Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 182, the court held\nthat where specific legislation provides a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d plaintiffs \u201cmay not\nuse the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.\u201d The court held\nfurther, however, that there is no implied \u201csafe harbor\u201d under California law\nfor claims asserted under the UCL. As defendant notes, Cel-Tech did not\naddress claims asserted under the CLRA. In any event, the Gray court\u2019s\nconclusion that the proposed duty would interfere with the statutory and\nregulatory requirements that hospitals provide emergency care without first\naddressing the costs for care or the patient\u2019s ability to pay does not imply a\n\u201csafe harbor\u201d for the alleged omission. (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at\np. 241.)\n      Nor did the Gray court conclude that defendant\u2019s duty to disclose the\nEMS Fee under the CLRA is expressly preempted by the EMTALA.10 To the\ncontrary, the court found that imposing a duty to disclose prior to providing\n\n      10Section 1395dd, subdivision (f) of the EMTALA states, \u201cThe\nprovisions of this section do not preempt any State or local law requirement,\nexcept to the extent that the requirement directly conflicts with a\nrequirement of this section.\u201d\n\n\n                                        14\n\fany emergency medical services \u201cis at odds with the spirit, if not the letter, of\nthe hospital\u2019s statutory and regulatory obligations with respect to providing\nemergency medical care.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 240.)\n      Finally, plaintiff argues for the first time on appeal that the defendant\ncould reasonably be required to disclose on its website that \u201cif a patient goes\nto the emergency room rather than an urgent care center, the patient will\nincur an [EMS Fee] in addition to the costs of the diagnostic testing and\ntreatments that are provided (and mentioned on the website).\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint, however, alleges only that defendant\u2019s failure to visibly post\nsignage in defendant\u2019s emergency rooms prior to treatment violates the\nCLRA. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertion, additional website disclosure is not\n\u201cwithin the scope of relief sought\u201d in his complaint.\n      Accordingly, the trial court properly sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer to\nplaintiff\u2019s cause of action under the CLRA. Moreover, the court did not, as\nplaintiff suggests, abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff leave to amend.\nPlaintiff asserts that he should be given leave to amend his complaint to\nallege a cause of action for breach of contract. He argues that the COA form\nhe signed provides that the patient is responsible only for charges \u201cfor care\nand services\u201d provided to the patient and that insofar as the EMS Fees are\ndesigned to cover the hospital\u2019s overhead, operating, and administrative\nexpenses, they are not recoverable under the terms of the agreement.11\n\n\n      11The form signed by plaintiff and submitted by defendant in\nconnection with its demurrer reads in relevant part, \u201cHOSPITAL CHARGES:\nThe Hospital\u2019s charges for care and services are calculated in accordance with\nthe Charge Description Master (\u2018CDM\u2019) in effect at the time services are\nprovided. If you would like to review the CDM charges, please request an\nappointment with a Patient Financial Services Counselor. You can also view\nthe Hospital\u2019s CDM online at: www.oshpd.ca.gov.\u201d The form adds with\n\n\n                                       15\n\fHowever, these allegations were included in plaintiff\u2019s original complaint to\nwhich a demurrer was sustained and they were not realleged in his amended\ncomplaint. By amending his complaint to omit the contract allegations,\nrather than appealing the trial court\u2019s order, plaintiff waived any argument\nthat those allegations sufficiently alleged a cause of action for breach of\ncontract. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966.)\n                                  Disposition\n      The judgment is affirmed. Defendant shall recover its costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            POLLAK, P.

(See fn. 8, post.)\n      3Plaintiff\u2019s opening brief indicates that his attorney, who also\nrepresented Gray, had filed a petition for review and request for\ndepublication of Gray with the California Supreme Court. Defendant\u2019s\nrequest that we take judicial notice of the January 26, 2022, order denying\nthat request is denied as unnecessary.\n      4  Section 1770 reads in relevant part: \u201c(a) The unfair methods of\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices listed in this subdivision\nundertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or that results\nin the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer are unlawful: [\u00b6] . . .\n[\u00b6] (5) Representing that goods or services have sponsorship, approval,\ncharacteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities that they do not\nhave or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation, or\nconnection that the person does not have.

His total\ncharges of $4,593 (before discounts) included the undisclosed EMS Fee in the\namount of $2,811. The complaint continues, \u201cPlaintiff is informed and\nbelieves and thereon alleges that, unlike other items billed to emergency\nroom patients, this [EMS Fee] is charged to emergency room patients simply\nfor seeking treatment in the emergency room and is designed to cover\n\u2018overhead\u2019 and general operating and staffing expenses for operating an\nemergency room on a 24 hour basis. It is not like other individual billable\nitems of treatment or services. Rather, it is . . . charged to every emergency\nroom patient who presents and is treated at any one of defendant\u2019s\nemergency rooms. Further, the fact that defendant intends to charge an EMS\nFee to patients simply for being seen in the emergency room is not visibly\nposted on signage in or around defendant\u2019s emergency rooms or at its\nregistration windows/desks, where a patient would at least have the\nopportunity of knowing of its existence . . . .\u201d Plaintiff alleges that patients\n\u201chave a right to know about [the EMS Fee], and defendant owed/owes\nplaintiff and class members a corresponding duty to notify them of such fee in\nadvance of providing treatment that triggers it.\u201d The complaint emphasizes,\n\u201cTo be clear, the signage that plaintiff would deem sufficient to notify\nprospective emergency room patients would be a simple, inexpensive matter,\nand would be of immense benefit to consumers, who would greatly benefit\nfrom a simple, prominent sign placed in defendant\u2019s emergency rooms.\u201d\n      California\u2019s \u201cPayers\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d Health and Safety Code\nsection 1339.50 et seq., sets forth obligations California hospitals owe to\nconsumers with respect to the pricing of medical services.

In addition, the Payers\u2019 Bill of Rights requires the hospital to\n\u201cpost a clear and conspicuous notice in its emergency department\u201d informing\npatients that the chargemaster is available for review and how it may be\naccessed. (Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 1339.51, subd.

The complaint clarifies that plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cnot\nthat defendant fails to list an EMS Fee as a line item in its published\nchargemasters, or that defendant fails to list the price of such fees in its\nchargemasters.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)

The two issues, posting of a chargemaster, and notifying\nprospective emergency room patients of the intention to assess an [EMS] Fee,\nare completely separate and very distinct issues.\u201d\n      The trial court sustained the hospital\u2019s demurrer to the amended\ncomplaint without leave to amend, concluding that defendant has no duty to\npost notice of the EMS Fee in its emergency room. The trial court ruled that\nthe allegations of the complaint show that defendant has complied with its\nstatutory disclosure obligations and that there is no duty to make an\nadditional disclosure of the EMS Fee in light of the public policy reflected in\nfederal and state statutes that emergency room care be provided to patients\nwithout delay or questioning about their ability to pay.

(d) [Hospitals must render emergency services \u201cwithout\nfirst questioning the patient or any other person as to his or her ability to pay\ntherefor.\u201d]; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(a) & (h) (Emergency Medical Treatment and\nActive Labor Act or EMTALA) [Medicare participating hospitals must\nprovide emergency services upon request and may not delay the provision of\nservices \u201cin order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or\ninsurance status.\u201d].)\n      Plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal from the subsequently entered\njudgment.\n                                  Discussion\n      \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018The [CLRA], enacted in 1970, \u201cestablished a nonexclusive statutory\nremedy for \u2018unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fwhich results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer. . . .\u2019\n[Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The self-declared purposes of the act are \u2018to protect\nconsumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide\nefficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Gray,\nsupra, 70 Cal.App.5th at pp. 242\u2013243.)\n      In Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at page 245, the court held that the\nplaintiff\u2019s assertion that the hospital failed to disclose, prior to providing\nmedical emergency treatment, that its billing for such treatment would\ninclude an emergency room charge (ER Charge) does not state a CLRA claim,\nunder section 1770, subdivision (a)(5) or (a)(14).6 In a well-reasoned opinion,\nthe court found that requiring such disclosure would be inconsistent with the\n\u201cstrong legislative policy\u201d reflected in the applicable \u201cmulti-faceted statutory\nand regulatory scheme\u201d designed \u201cto ensure that emergency medical care is\nprovided immediately to those who need it, and that billing disclosure\nrequirements are not to stand in the way of this paramount objective.\u201d (Id. at\np. 241, citing Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1317, subd. (d), 1339.51, subd.

(a)(1), 84\nFed.Reg. 65524-01 at p. 65564.) The court explained, \u201cNot only did [the\nhospital] fully comply with all state and federal disclosure requirements,\nincluding the requirement that there be signage in its emergency room\ndepartments stating how its pricing information can be accessed [citation],\nbut requiring individualized disclosure that the hospital will include an ER\nCharge in its emergency room billing, prior to providing any emergency\nmedical services, is at odds with the spirit, if not the letter, of the hospital\u2019s\nstatutory and regulatory obligations with respect to providing emergency\n\n\n      6There is no dispute that the \u201cER Charge\u201d referred to in Gray is the\nsame fee as the EMS Fee at issue in the present case.\n\n\n                                         6\n\fmedical care.\u201d (Id. at p. 240.) The court added, \u201cGray claims Dignity owes this\npretreatment disclosure duty in order to accomplish an objective antithetical\nto state and federal law\u2014to discourage some patients from remaining in the\nemergency room and receiving medical care. He asserts, for example, that if\nsignage were posted\u2014identifying the cost of each of the five levels of ER\nCharges (ranging from $984 to $7,356), each level accompanied by a one-word\ndescriptor (ranging from \u2018minor\u2019 to \u2018complex/life-threatening\u2019), with a caveat\nthat these are \u2018gross\u2019 charges prior to insurance and any other reduction and\n\u2018[y]our . . . costs may be substantially less\u2019\u2014this would be \u2018particularly\nbeneficial\u2019 to patients with \u2018relatively minor ailments\u2019 and go a long way\ntowards making emergency departments \u2018less crowded.\u2019 Even if lessening the\nload on our emergency rooms might be a laudable goal, Gray\u2019s sweeping\nassumption that those seeking care at an emergency department can\naccurately diagnose whether their ailment is \u2018relatively minor\u2019 and whether\nthey can safely transport themselves or be transported to a lower acuity\nfacility, is unsupportable. And while Gray complains this is a \u2018paternalistic\u2019\nattitude and asserts every person has a right to decide for him or herself\nwhether to seek medical treatment at an emergency department, and to do so\nbased on readily accessible cost information, this disregards the long\nstanding regulatory environment within which emergency departments\noperate, which emphasizes that no one in need of emergency care should be\ndeterred from receiving it because of its cost.\u201d (Id. at pp. 241\u2013242.)7\n\n\n      7 The court also held that the same allegations failed to state a cause of\naction under section 1170, subdivision (a)(14). (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 245.) The court explained, \u201cGray does not allege any collateral oral\nmisrepresentation by Dignity that is at odds with the terms of the hospital\u2019s\n[conditions of admission (COA)]. Nor does he allege that Dignity\u2019s COA\ncontains any term prohibited by law. The only allegation Gray makes with\n\n\n                                        7\n\f      We agree defendant does not have a duty under the CLRA to disclose\nthe EMS Fee by posting additional signage in its emergency rooms. As\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint acknowledges, the EMS Fee is disclosed in the hospital\u2019s\nchargemaster in compliance with state and federal law. Making the\nunsupported assumption that this disclosure is insufficient and does not in\nfact convey the necessary information to one seeking this information before\nreceiving emergency room treatment, there nonetheless is no basis to require\nfurther disclosure. Courts have \u201cidentified four situations in which a failure\nto disclose a fact constitutes a deceptive practice actionable under the CLRA.\n[Citation.] Those situations arise when the defendant is the plaintiff\u2019s\nfiduciary, when the defendant has exclusive knowledge of material facts not\nknown or reasonably accessible to the plaintiff, and when the defendant\nactively conceals a material fact. In addition, the duty to disclose exists \u2018when\nthe defendant makes partial representations that are misleading because\nsome other material fact has not been disclosed.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . In other\nwords, a defendant has a duty to disclose when the fact is known to the\ndefendant and the failure to disclose it is \u2018 \u201cmisleading in light of other facts\n. . . that [the defendant] did disclose.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto\nSuperstores California (2018) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">19 Cal.App.5th 1234</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1258 (Gutierrez).) The\nexistence of a duty to disclose under the CLRA presents a legal question\nsubject to our de novo review. (Ibid.)\n\n\n\nrespect to the hospital\u2019s COA is that \u2018under Hospital\u2019s Contract,\u2019 he is\nassertedly \u2018not required to pay\u2019 the \u2018undisclosed\u2019 ER Charge. At most, he has\nalleged a breach of contract, which, alone, is not sufficient to state a claim\nunder Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(14).\u201d (Ibid.) Here, plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint does not include any allegations regarding defendant\u2019s COA. His\ncontention that he can amend the complaint to add such allegations and a\ncause of action for breach of contract is addressed post.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      Plaintiff argues that defendant had a duty to disclose under the CLRA\nbased on its \u201cexclusive knowledge\u201d and \u201cintentional concealment\u201d as alleged\nin his complaint. In this regard, plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that defendant\nhad \u201cexclusive knowledge that it would be billing plaintiff and class members\nsuch an [EMS] Fee;\u201d that \u201cthis fact was not known or reasonably accessible to\nplaintiff or class members at the time of their emergency room visits\u201d; that\n\u201c[s]uch charges are effectively hidden by defendant\u2019s intentional failure to\nprovide notice of them in its emergency rooms;\u201d and that \u201cdefendant\nintentionally conceals such fees.\u201d\n      In sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer, the trial court acknowledged that\ndefendant \u201chad a duty to disclose medical care fees generally\u201d based on its\n\u201cexclusive knowledge of material facts not known or reasonably accessible to\nthe plaintiff,\u201d but concluded that defendant did not have an additional duty\nto disclose the EMS Fee in the manner alleged in the complaint. We agree\nwith the trial court\u2019s reasoning. The hospital has a duty under the CLRA, as\nwell as the many statutes cited above, to disclose the fees it intends to charge\nfor its goods and services, including the EMS Fee. It does so in its\nchargemaster, to which signage in the emergency room directs those\ninterested.8 The question here, however, is whether defendant has a duty to\n\n\n      8 In Torres v. Adventist Health System/West, supra, 77Cal.App.5th at\npage 513, the court held that the hospital\u2019s compliance with the statutory\ndisclosure standards, including publication of its chargemaster, did not\nestablish that plaintiff had reasonable access to the material facts about its\nEMS Fee. Relying on allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint that the\nhospital\u2019s \u201cchargemaster was \u2018unusable and effectively worthless for the\npurpose of providing pricing information to consumers\u2019; the chargemaster\nfailed to include the standardized [current procedural terminology] codes\nrecognized in the industry; and the chargemaster used coding and highly\nabbreviated descriptions that are meaningless to consumers\u201d (id. at p. 512),\n\n\n                                       9\n\fcall attention to the EMS Fee by additional signage in the emergency room\nvisible to a person seeking emergency care. The Gray court concluded that for\nthe reasons it explained no such duty exists, and we agree.\n      Plaintiff faults the Gray decision for failing to distinguish between\ndiscouraging treatment by questioning patients as to their \u201cability to pay\u201d for\nthe treatment and merely providing information about the cost of treatment\nso that the patient can make an informed decision. He argues that neither\nthe letter nor purpose of the state and federal statutes \u201cis to require a\nhospital to withhold pricing information or fail to inform the patient as to the\nhospital\u2019s intent to assess an [EMS] Fee for their emergency room visit.\u201d But\nthere is no withholding of information that is provided on the hospital\u2019s\nchargemaster.\n      Moreover, the court in Gray carefully considered the competing\ninterests served by ensuring that patients are fully apprised in advance of\nthe costs of emergency services and ensuring that patients have timely access\n\n\nthe court reasoned that it could not \u201cconclude as a matter of law that an\nobjectively reasonable person who reviewed Hospital\u2019s chargemaster . . .\ncould discern the circumstances in which the EMS Fee is charged or how the\namount of the EMS Fee is determined\u201d (id. at p. 513). We need not reach this\nissue, however, as plaintiff\u2019s complaint expressly disavows any claim that\n\u201cdefendant fails to list an EMS Fee as a line item in its published\nchargemasters, or that defendant fails to list the price of such fees in its\nchargemasters.\u201d Moreover, the chargemaster is required to be filed annually\nwith the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (Health &\nSaf. Code, \u00a7 1339.55, subd. (a)) and that department is charged with\ninvestigating claims alleging a violation of the statute and requiring\ncorrective action. (Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 1339.54 [\u201cAny person may file a\nclaim with the department alleging a violation of this article. The department\nshall investigate and inform the complaining person of its determination\nwhether a violation has occurred and what action it will take.\u201d].) Accordingly,\nwe do not imply that defendant\u2019s chargemaster provides insufficient notice of\nthe existence of the EMS Fee.\n\n\n                                       10\n\fto emergency services. The court observed, \u201cIt is also telling that in\nexpanding the pricing disclosure obligations of hospitals under the [Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act (Pub.L. No. 111-148 (Mar. 23, 2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">124\nStat. 119</span><pre class=\"inline\">) (Affordable Care Act)], federal regulators took care to ensure that\nthese new obligations do not interfere with the emergency treatment\nobligations under the EMTALA. As we have discussed, the new pricing\ndisclosure requirements are focused on \u2018shoppable\u2019 medical services, that is,\nservices that can be scheduled in advance and, by definition, are not\nemergency medical services. Thus, the new pricing information is to be posted\non-line in a readily accessible format for use by consumers planning for\nscheduled medical treatment. People seek emergency medical treatment, in\ncontrast, for serious, and often grave, unplanned accidents or medical\ncalamities.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 241.) The court also cited\nlegislative history showing that \u201cwhen concern was raised that the new\nfederal disclosure requirements [under the Affordable Care Act] might\ninterfere with a hospital\u2019s obligations under the EMTALA\u2014including\nproviding emergency treatment to any person who seeks it and providing\nsuch treatment before any discussion about ability to pay\u2014the [Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services] stated, \u2018the price transparency provisions . . .\ndo not require that hospitals post any signage or make any statement at the\nemergency department regarding the cost of emergency care or any hospital\npolicies regarding prepayment of fees or payment of co-pays and deductibles.\n[Citation.] And while the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] lauded\nhospitals that go beyond posting the new pricing information, the efforts it\nidentified were post-treatment financial counseling and workable payment\nstrategies.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 241.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f      Plaintiff cites to additional legislative history suggesting that the\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services has considered whether hospitals\nshould make public standard charges and \u201coffer consumers opportunities for\ninformed decision-making by providing them with information about the cost\nof care which, for example, they might consider prior to visiting a hospital\nemergency department for treatment of a non-life threatening condition.\u201d\n(Citing 84 Fed.Reg. 65524-01 at p. 65536.) But, as Gray makes clear, the\nstate and federal legislative bodies are in a superior position to balance these\ncompeting interests and have done so in crafting the applicable \u201cmultifaceted\nstatutory and regulatory scheme.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 241.)\nOur conclusion is consistent with the balance struck by the existing\nregulatory scheme and does not, as plaintiff suggests, disregard the\n\u201cimportant policy in favor of providing pricing transparency to medical\npatients.\u201d\n      This reasoning applies with equal force to the alleged omission under\nsection 1770, subdivision (a)(14). Plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not distinguish\nbetween alleged omissions with respect to the \u201cservices and/or supplies\u201d it\nprovides and omission regarding the \u201ctransaction\u201d between it and plaintiff.9\n\n\n\n\n      9 Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges, \u201cAt all relevant times, defendant violated\nthe CLRA by engaging in and continuing to engage in deceptive practices,\nunlawful methods of competition, and/or unfair acts to the detriment of\nplaintiff and the class, including, but not limited to, the following: [\u00b6] (a) In\nviolation of Civil Code section 1770(a)(5), which applies in the context of\nomissions as well as affirmative misrepresentations, defendant\u2019s acts and\npractices constitute omissions/concealment that the services and/or supplies\nin question had characteristics, uses and/or benefits which they did not have;\nand [\u00b6] (b) In violation of Civil Code section 1770(a)(14), which also applies in\nthe context of omissions as well as affirmative misrepresentations, defendant\nomits/conceals that a transaction involves obligations which it does have.\u201d\n\n\n                                       12\n\f      Plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments that Gray was wrongly decided also\nlack merit. Initially, plaintiff argues that Gray is inapposite because it\nprimarily addresses Gray\u2019s claims under the UCL. While much of the\nanalysis quoted above is found within the court\u2019s discussion of Gray\u2019s claim\nunder the UCL (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at pp. 240\u2013242), the court then\nconcluded, with respect to Gray\u2019s CRLA claims, that \u201c[f]or all the reasons we\nhave discussed in connection with Gray's \u2018unfair\u2019 business practice claim,\nDignity did not owe Gray the duty he claims was owed in this case\u2014to\ndisclose, prior to providing any medical emergency treatment, that its billing\nfor such treatment would include an ER Charge.\u201d (Id. at p. 244.)\n      Plaintiff also argues that the Gray decision incorrectly relies on Nolte v.\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">236 Cal.App.4th 1401</span><pre class=\"inline\"> because the facility\nfee at issue in Nolte is distinguishable from the EMS Fee and ER Charge at\nissue here and in Gray. In Nolte, the court held that the plaintiff failed to\nstate a cause of action under the UCL based on allegations Cedars-Sinai had\nnot \u201cspecifically, separately, and individually disclose[d]\u201d an administrative\ncharge prior to the plaintiff receiving services from a physician at a hospital\nmedical facility. (Id. at p. 1408.) The court explained that Nolte\u2019s complaint\ndid \u201cnot allege (and the law does not provide) that Nolte had the right to have\nevery individual charge specifically disclosed to him in advance before Cedars\nissued a bill. Cedars\u2019s obligation to Nolte and other consumers of medical\nservices was that Cedars make a written or electronic copy of its schedule of\ncharges available in the manner codified in section 1339.51 of the Health and\nSafety Code, and there is no allegation that Cedars did not do so. Further,\n\u2018there is no requirement [under the UCL] that reasonable notice has to be the\nbest possible notice.\u2019 \u201d (Nolte, at p. 1409.) The court in Gray found that Nolte\nwas analogous and agreed with its holding. (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\fp. 238.) Although plaintiff here is correct that the \u201cfacility fee\u201d at issue in\nNolte is different from the fee at issue in Gray and the present case, the\nsituation nonetheless remains analogous. As the court in Gray explained,\n\u201cThis is essentially the same claim Gray advances here\u2014that, prior to\nproviding any emergency medical services, Dignity is required to disclose that\nits billing for such services will include an ER Charge. The factual\ndistinctions to which Gray points are immaterial.\u201d (Gray, at p. 240.) We agree\nthat Nolte is analogous and well-reasoned.\n      Plaintiff contends the court in Gray improperly implied a \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nfor the hospital\u2019s alleged omission. In Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v.\nLos Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1301891\"><a href=\"/opinion/1301891/cel-tech-communications-v-la-cellular/\">20 Cal.4th 163</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182, the court held\nthat where specific legislation provides a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d plaintiffs \u201cmay not\nuse the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.\u201d The court held\nfurther, however, that there is no implied \u201csafe harbor\u201d under California law\nfor claims asserted under the UCL. As defendant notes, Cel-Tech did not\naddress claims asserted under the CLRA. In any event, the Gray court\u2019s\nconclusion that the proposed duty would interfere with the statutory and\nregulatory requirements that hospitals provide emergency care without first\naddressing the costs for care or the patient\u2019s ability to pay does not imply a\n\u201csafe harbor\u201d for the alleged omission. (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at\np. 241.)\n      Nor did the Gray court conclude that defendant\u2019s duty to disclose the\nEMS Fee under the CLRA is expressly preempted by the EMTALA.10 To the\ncontrary, the court found that imposing a duty to disclose prior to providing\n\n      10Section 1395dd, subdivision (f) of the EMTALA states, \u201cThe\nprovisions of this section do not preempt any State or local law requirement,\nexcept to the extent that the requirement directly conflicts with a\nrequirement of this section.\u201d\n\n\n                                        14\n\fany emergency medical services \u201cis at odds with the spirit, if not the letter, of\nthe hospital\u2019s statutory and regulatory obligations with respect to providing\nemergency medical care.\u201d (Gray, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th at p. 240.)\n      Finally, plaintiff argues for the first time on appeal that the defendant\ncould reasonably be required to disclose on its website that \u201cif a patient goes\nto the emergency room rather than an urgent care center, the patient will\nincur an [EMS Fee] in addition to the costs of the diagnostic testing and\ntreatments that are provided (and mentioned on the website).\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s\ncomplaint, however, alleges only that defendant\u2019s failure to visibly post\nsignage in defendant\u2019s emergency rooms prior to treatment violates the\nCLRA. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertion, additional website disclosure is not\n\u201cwithin the scope of relief sought\u201d in his complaint.\n      Accordingly, the trial court properly sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer to\nplaintiff\u2019s cause of action under the CLRA. Moreover, the court did not, as\nplaintiff suggests, abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff leave to amend.\nPlaintiff asserts that he should be given leave to amend his complaint to\nallege a cause of action for breach of contract. He argues that the COA form\nhe signed provides that the patient is responsible only for charges \u201cfor care\nand services\u201d provided to the patient and that insofar as the EMS Fees are\ndesigned to cover the hospital\u2019s overhead, operating, and administrative\nexpenses, they are not recoverable under the terms of the agreement.11\n\n\n      11The form signed by plaintiff and submitted by defendant in\nconnection with its demurrer reads in relevant part, \u201cHOSPITAL CHARGES:\nThe Hospital\u2019s charges for care and services are calculated in accordance with\nthe Charge Description Master (\u2018CDM\u2019) in effect at the time services are\nprovided. If you would like to review the CDM charges, please request an\nappointment with a Patient Financial Services Counselor. You can also view\nthe Hospital\u2019s CDM online at: www.oshpd.ca.gov.\u201d The form adds with\n\n\n                                       15\n\fHowever, these allegations were included in plaintiff\u2019s original complaint to\nwhich a demurrer was sustained and they were not realleged in his amended\ncomplaint. By amending his complaint to omit the contract allegations,\nrather than appealing the trial court\u2019s order, plaintiff waived any argument\nthat those allegations sufficiently alleged a cause of action for breach of\ncontract.

Sanders, appeals his natural-life sentence for first-degree murder\n\n(720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) (West 2016) (intent to cause death or great bodily harm)) and his\n\nconsecutive sentences of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for home invasion (720 ILCS 5/19-6(a)(2) (West\n\n2016) (entry with intent to cause injury)), and 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for residential burglary (720\n\nILCS 5/19-3(a) (West 2016)). He argues that the trial court did not adequately consider his\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U\n\n\nrehabilitative potential in imposing his sentences. He asks that we reduce his sentences or remand\n\nto the trial court for a new sentencing hearing. We affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64     A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, home invasion, and residential\n\nburglary. It also found that (1) the first-degree murder manifested exceptionally brutal or heinous\n\nbehavior indicative of wanton cruelty and (2) defendant murdered the victim in the course of\n\nanother felony. Either finding would support a sentence of natural-life imprisonment. See 720\n\nILCS 5/9-1(b)(6) (West 2018); 730 ILCS 5-4.5-20(a), 5-8-1(a)(1)(b) (West 2016).\n\n\u00b65     The victim of the offenses was Andrea Urban, who, on May 4, 2017, was found murdered\n\nin her house. There was no evidence of forced entry to the house. On the morning of May 7,\n\nneighbors saw defendant walking in the vicinity of Urban\u2019s home. He was wearing a reflective\n\nyellow vest similar to those worn in construction or utility work. When interviewed by the police\n\nin connection with the murder, defendant acknowledged that he wore the vest to make others feel\n\nmore comfortable around him.\n\n\u00b66     The evidence showed that Urban was killed by repeated blows to her head with a blunt\n\ninstrument. Among other injuries, there was a \u201chinge fracture\u201d across the base of her skull. This\n\n\u201cbasically split the base of the skull in two\u201d; such an injury required great force, such as would\n\noccur in a car accident. Urban\u2019s throat was slashed on one side exposing the larynx, but, although\n\nthis injury contributed to her death, it was not the primary cause of her death. Her nose was broken.\n\nAll her clothing was bloodstained. Her mock turtleneck, sleeveless dress, tank top, and bra were\n\ncut on one side to expose her body. Her skirt and leggings were also cut or torn on the right side.\n\nHer skirt was pushed up, her leggings were pulled down, and her underpants were ripped off. There\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U\n\n\nwas blood in her underpants and small abrasions at the opening of her vagina. No semen was\n\ndetected on Urban\u2019s body, and no male DNA was detected in vaginal, rectal, and buccal swabs.\n\n\u00b67     The trial evidence suggested that the cuts were inflicted by a knife taken from Urban\u2019s\n\nkitchen and that the knife was broken during the attack. Further evidence showed that defendant\n\nhad taken jewelry from Urban and sold it.\n\n\u00b68     At sentencing, the State presented evidence of two incidents while defendant was in pretrial\n\ndetention. First, on May 28, 2017, defendant called his mother and asked her to destroy physical\n\nevidence. Second, on December 24, 2019, defendant and Vshonne Dawkins attacked a fellow\n\ninmate, 53-year-old Steven Kelly, and inflicted serious injuries. Jail security cameras captured the\n\nattack. Defendant and Dawkins entered Kelly\u2019s cell and picked up a bin containing items that Kelly\n\nhad bought from the commissary. Kelly approached them. Kelly was struck and pushed out of his\n\ncell. He fell to the floor. Defendant and Dawkins then kicked and punched him multiple times in\n\nthe body and face. Kelly suffered a subdural hematoma, multiple rib fractures, and a punctured\n\nlung. Defendant told a corrections officer that his conflict with Kelly had begun several days before\n\nthe beating. Kelly had repeatedly called defendant a racial slur. After reviewing the security video,\n\nthe trial court characterized the incident with Kelly as \u201ca vicious, unprovoked attack\u201d and noted\n\nthat defendant was \u201cthe main person involved.\u201d\n\n\u00b69     Defendant had multiple prior convictions of forgery and identity theft. He had no record of\n\nprior violent offenses. Defendant reported a history of alcohol abuse but denied any other\n\nsubstance abuse. He was expelled from high school but later obtained his equivalency certificate.\n\n\u00b6 10   The court, in imposing sentence, agreed with the jury that Urban\u2019s murder was\n\nexceptionally brutal and heinous and indicative of wanton cruelty. In the court\u2019s words, it was\n\n\u201csavagely violent, savagely vicious, utterly wicked, and evil.\u201d The court found no mitigating factor\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U\n\n\nthat \u201cin any way remotely applie[d]\u201d to defendant. The court noted that defendant submitted in\n\nmitigation many letters attesting to his kindness and nonviolent nature\u2014all of them insisting that\n\nhe would never commit such an act. The court suggested that these individuals \u201creally d[id]n\u2019t\n\nknow the defendant\u201d and that his true character was shown in the brutal murder of Urban and the\n\nsimilarly brutal beating of Kelly. The court also found that defendant\u2019s criminal history, though\n\nnonviolent, was \u201chorrendous\u201d and indicated little rehabilitative potential. The court summarized:\n\n\u201cMerciless. Malicious. Inhumane. A total lack of compassion. [Defendant], you are all of those\n\nthings and more, and the public needs to be protected from you forever.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 11   The court imposed a discretionary sentence of natural-life imprisonment for the murder\n\nconviction in addition to sentences of 30- and 15-years\u2019 imprisonment for home invasion and\n\nresidential burglary. The court also determined that consecutive sentencing was mandatory\n\nbecause defendant inflicted severe bodily injury to the victim. 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4(d)(1) (West\n\n2018). Defendant did not move for reconsideration but instead filed a timely appeal.\n\n\u00b6 12                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 13   Defendant concedes that, because defense counsel did not file a postsentencing motion,\n\ndefendant has forfeited any claim of sentencing error. See, e.g., People v. Harvey, 2018 IL 122325,\n\n\u00b6 15 (\u201cIn order to preserve a claim of sentencing error, both a contemporaneous objection and a\n\nwritten postsentencing motion raising the issue are required.\u201d). He contends that we can\n\nnonetheless reach his claim for either of two reasons: (1) the claimed error was plain error (see\n\nPeople v. Hillier, 237 Ill. 2d 539, 545 (2010)) or (2) defense counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\npreserve the claim for appeal (see People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176, 201 (1988)). He asks that we\n\nreduce his sentences or remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U\n\n\n\u00b6 14   Even if we bypassed defendant\u2019s forfeiture, and reviewed his claim of a sentencing error,\n\nwe would review it only for an abuse of discretion. See People v. Miller, 2014 IL App (2d)\n\n120873, \u00b6 35. And even if we undertake that review, we find no basis to disturb defendant\u2019s\n\nsentence.\n\n\u00b6 15   The controlling principles are well settled:\n\n       \u201cA sentence will be deemed an abuse of discretion where the sentence is greatly at variance\n\n       with the spirit and purpose of the law, or manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the\n\n       offense.

He argues that the trial court did not adequately consider his\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nrehabilitative potential in imposing his sentences. He asks that we reduce his sentences or remand\n\nto the trial court for a new sentencing hearing. We affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64     A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, home invasion, and residential\n\nburglary. It also found that (1) the first-degree murder manifested exceptionally brutal or heinous\n\nbehavior indicative of wanton cruelty and (2) defendant murdered the victim in the course of\n\nanother felony. Either finding would support a sentence of natural-life imprisonment. See 720\n\nILCS 5/9-1(b)(6) (West 2018); 730 ILCS 5-4.5-20(a), 5-8-1(a)(1)(b) (West 2016).\n\n\u00b65     The victim of the offenses was Andrea Urban, who, on May 4, 2017, was found murdered\n\nin her house. There was no evidence of forced entry to the house. On the morning of May 7,\n\nneighbors saw defendant walking in the vicinity of Urban\u2019s home. He was wearing a reflective\n\nyellow vest similar to those worn in construction or utility work. When interviewed by the police\n\nin connection with the murder, defendant acknowledged that he wore the vest to make others feel\n\nmore comfortable around him.\n\n\u00b66     The evidence showed that Urban was killed by repeated blows to her head with a blunt\n\ninstrument. Among other injuries, there was a \u201chinge fracture\u201d across the base of her skull. This\n\n\u201cbasically split the base of the skull in two\u201d; such an injury required great force, such as would\n\noccur in a car accident. Urban\u2019s throat was slashed on one side exposing the larynx, but, although\n\nthis injury contributed to her death, it was not the primary cause of her death. Her nose was broken.\n\nAll her clothing was bloodstained. Her mock turtleneck, sleeveless dress, tank top, and bra were\n\ncut on one side to expose her body. Her skirt and leggings were also cut or torn on the right side.\n\nHer skirt was pushed up, her leggings were pulled down, and her underpants were ripped off. There\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nwas blood in her underpants and small abrasions at the opening of her vagina. No semen was\n\ndetected on Urban\u2019s body, and no male DNA was detected in vaginal, rectal, and buccal swabs.\n\n\u00b67     The trial evidence suggested that the cuts were inflicted by a knife taken from Urban\u2019s\n\nkitchen and that the knife was broken during the attack. Further evidence showed that defendant\n\nhad taken jewelry from Urban and sold it.\n\n\u00b68     At sentencing, the State presented evidence of two incidents while defendant was in pretrial\n\ndetention. First, on May 28, 2017, defendant called his mother and asked her to destroy physical\n\nevidence. Second, on December 24, 2019, defendant and Vshonne Dawkins attacked a fellow\n\ninmate, 53-year-old Steven Kelly, and inflicted serious injuries. Jail security cameras captured the\n\nattack. Defendant and Dawkins entered Kelly\u2019s cell and picked up a bin containing items that Kelly\n\nhad bought from the commissary. Kelly approached them. Kelly was struck and pushed out of his\n\ncell. He fell to the floor. Defendant and Dawkins then kicked and punched him multiple times in\n\nthe body and face. Kelly suffered a subdural hematoma, multiple rib fractures, and a punctured\n\nlung. Defendant told a corrections officer that his conflict with Kelly had begun several days before\n\nthe beating. Kelly had repeatedly called defendant a racial slur. After reviewing the security video,\n\nthe trial court characterized the incident with Kelly as \u201ca vicious, unprovoked attack\u201d and noted\n\nthat defendant was \u201cthe main person involved.\u201d\n\n\u00b69     Defendant had multiple prior convictions of forgery and identity theft. He had no record of\n\nprior violent offenses. Defendant reported a history of alcohol abuse but denied any other\n\nsubstance abuse. He was expelled from high school but later obtained his equivalency certificate.\n\n\u00b6 10   The court, in imposing sentence, agreed with the jury that Urban\u2019s murder was\n\nexceptionally brutal and heinous and indicative of wanton cruelty. In the court\u2019s words, it was\n\n\u201csavagely violent, savagely vicious, utterly wicked, and evil.\u201d The court found no mitigating factor\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nthat \u201cin any way remotely applie[d]\u201d to defendant. The court noted that defendant submitted in\n\nmitigation many letters attesting to his kindness and nonviolent nature\u2014all of them insisting that\n\nhe would never commit such an act. The court suggested that these individuals \u201creally d[id]n\u2019t\n\nknow the defendant\u201d and that his true character was shown in the brutal murder of Urban and the\n\nsimilarly brutal beating of Kelly. The court also found that defendant\u2019s criminal history, though\n\nnonviolent, was \u201chorrendous\u201d and indicated little rehabilitative potential. The court summarized:\n\n\u201cMerciless. Malicious. Inhumane. A total lack of compassion. [Defendant], you are all of those\n\nthings and more, and the public needs to be protected from you forever.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 11   The court imposed a discretionary sentence of natural-life imprisonment for the murder\n\nconviction in addition to sentences of 30- and 15-years\u2019 imprisonment for home invasion and\n\nresidential burglary. The court also determined that consecutive sentencing was mandatory\n\nbecause defendant inflicted severe bodily injury to the victim. 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4(d)(1) (West\n\n2018). Defendant did not move for reconsideration but instead filed a timely appeal.\n\n\u00b6 12                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 13   Defendant concedes that, because defense counsel did not file a postsentencing motion,\n\ndefendant has forfeited any claim of sentencing error. See, e.g., People v. Harvey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4364840\"><a href=\"/opinion/4587587/people-v-harvey/\">2018 IL 122325</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\u00b6 15 (\u201cIn order to preserve a claim of sentencing error, both a contemporaneous objection and a\n\nwritten postsentencing motion raising the issue are required.\u201d). He contends that we can\n\nnonetheless reach his claim for either of two reasons: (1) the claimed error was plain error (see\n\nPeople v. Hillier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2076100\"><a href=\"/opinion/2076100/people-v-hillier/\">237 Ill. 2d 539</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (2010)) or (2) defense counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\npreserve the claim for appeal (see People v. Enoch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2139907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2139907/people-v-enoch/\">122 Ill. 2d 176</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (1988)). He asks that we\n\nreduce his sentences or remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 200365-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\u00b6 14   Even if we bypassed defendant\u2019s forfeiture, and reviewed his claim of a sentencing error,\n\nwe would review it only for an abuse of discretion. See People v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2014 IL App (2d)\n\n120873</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 35. And even if we undertake that review, we find no basis to disturb defendant\u2019s\n\nsentence.\n\n\u00b6 15   The controlling principles are well settled:\n\n       \u201cA sentence will be deemed an abuse of discretion where the sentence is greatly at variance\n\n       with the spirit and purpose of the law, or manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the\n\n       offense. [Citations.]\n\n               The trial court has broad discretionary powers in imposing a sentence, and its\n\n       sentencing decisions are entitled to great deference.

We authorize Stephen\n                to execute a corrected deed from the Family Trust.\n\f\u00b62          Petitioner Stephen Ficklin, in response to an order of the trial court granting a motion\n\n     filed by respondents Katherine Kuipers and Russell Ficklin to set aside a deed in which he had\n\n     conveyed two parcels from a Family Trust, of which he was trustee, to himself, sought leave to\n\n     reopen the estate of the parties\u2019 father, Roy L. Ficklin, which had closed eight years earlier. All\n\n     parties are surviving adult children of Roy Ficklin. Over respondents\u2019 objection, the trial court\n\n     granted the petition and allowed Stephen to issue himself a warranty deed for the two tracts of\n\n     land he had transferred to a family trust a year before his father\u2019s estate was closed. Thereafter,\n\n     Stephen filed an inventory, final accounting, and final report in Roy\u2019s reopened estate. The trial\n\n     court accepted the final report and closed the estate over Respondents\u2019 objection. Katherine and\n\n     Russell have appealed.\n\n\u00b63                                                 FACTS\n\n\u00b64          Roy L. Ficklin, a long time Illinois farmer, died testate on May 24, 2008, in Iroquois\n\n     County. He was survived by his wife, Lucille, and his three adult children, Stephen, Katherine,\n\n     and Russell. Roy's will included provisions directing gifts and distributions of property to his\n\n     wife and children with variations depending on whether or not Lucille survived him. Stephen\n\n     was designated as the estate\u2019s executor and administrator. The will, which is quite long and\n\n     detailed, contained four major distributive provisions pertinent to this appeal. One of those\n\n     provisions makes the terms of a specific land trust relevant as well.\n\n\u00b65          In Article 2 of the will, entitled \u201cGifts on My Death,\u201d Roy made the following bequests:\n\n            A. All his tangible personal property, which is specifically defined in section 2.1,\n\n                to Lucille because she survived him.\n\n            B. The \u201ctax-sheltered gift\u201d to a trustee to hold as a Family Trust. The administration and\n\n                distribution of the assets of this trust on termination were described in Article 4. The\n\n\n                                                       2\n\f      \u201ctax-sheltered gift\u201d was defined in Article 14, section 14.11 and it included, but was\n\n      not limited to, two parcels of real estate held in Land Trust 104. The Family Trust\n\n      section provided for payment of all income to Lucille, for potential invasion of\n\n      principal if necessary for her health and maintenance, and, upon her death, for\n\n      termination of the trust and distribution of its assets to the living children, per stirpes,\n\n      in equal shares.\n\nC. The \u201cbalance of [the] estate\u201d to a trustee to hold as a Marital Trust. The\n\n      administration and distribution of the trust assets in equal shares, per stirpes, on its\n\n      termination were described in Article 3. The \u201cbalance of the estate\u201d is defined in\n\n      Article 14, section 14.1.1 Stephen was named trustee of both the Family Trust and\n\n      Marital Trust, with Katherine and Russell identified as potential successors if Stephen\n\n      failed to so act.\n\nD. Certain specific bequests which \u201cshall be added\u201d to the distribution of each child\u2019s\n\n      share \u201cnotwithstanding the foregoing provisions\u201d (described in A \u2013 C above):\n\n      (1) to Stephen (section 2.4) two specifically identified parcels of real property.\n\n          Roy stated that \u201cno portion of [those] parcels shall pass to the other shares for my\n\n          remaining children (or their descendants).\u201d He acknowledged that this addition to\n\n          Stephen\u2019s otherwise-equal share would result in the passing of unequal shares to\n\n          his children. Because these parcels were included in Land Trust 104, the will\n\n          directed that \u201call interest in the beneficial interest therein and power of direction\n\n          thereover\u201d should pass the same way the parcels did.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    No \u201cbalance\u201d remained after the creation of the Family Trust, so this trust was never created.\n                                               3\n\f            (2) to Katherine (section 2.5) the residence on East Lincoln in Onarga, Illinois. As\n\n                with Stephen\u2019s bequest, Roy stated that the other two children and their\n\n                descendants should have no interest in this bequest to Katherine. He also\n\n                acknowledged that this addition to Katherine\u2019s otherwise-equal share would result\n\n                in the passing of unequal shares to his children. 2\n\n            (3) to Russell (section 2.6) there was no bequest of real property, however he would\n\n                receive, presumably solely, the benefits of the Roy F. Ficklin Irrevocable Life\n\n                Insurance Trust.\n\n        E. The will also contained an Article 16, entitled \u201cStatement of Purpose and Estate\n\n            Planning Agreement\u201d in which Roy described, clearly and in significant detail, the\n\n            time and thought he and Lucille had put into determining how their assets should be\n\n            divided among their children and the care they had taken to discuss with the children,\n\n            as a family unit, the decisions they had made and the reasons for them. He referenced\n\n            their need to balance their business responsibilities to Stephen with their personal\n\n            desire to treat all of their children both fairly and equally. He asked that the children\n\n            respect, understand, and appreciate their arrangements as expressions of love for all\n\n            of them and that they maintain and grow their familial relationships. He further stated\n\n            that, to ensure that their intentions would take effect, he and Lucille had executed\n\n            reciprocal wills, had agreed that neither of them, while they both lived, would make\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           In Article 15, seemingly to ensure protection of this bequest even while Lucille continued to live\nin the residence, Roy authorized, but did not require, his executor to put the residence in yet another trust\nproviding that, no matter what Lucille elected to do with it, that residence, any replacement residence, or\nthe proceeds of any sale would remain sheltered for Katherine.\n                                                     4\n\f                 any changes, and had provided that any changes after the death of one of them \u201cmay\n\n                 only be taken with the written consent of all three of our then living children\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00b66           Roy\u2019s will was executed April 28, 2008. On that same day Lucille transferred her 50%\n\n     beneficial interest in Land Trust 104 to Roy. Less than a month later, on May 24, 2008, Roy\n\n     died. At the time of his death, he owned 100% of that beneficial interest.\n\n\u00b67           On June 20, 2008, Stephen filed a petition to begin the probate of his father's estate in\n\n     Iroquois County. The Will was admitted to probate with Stephen appearing both as\n\n     representative/administrator of Roy\u2019s estate and individually as an heir. An inventory of the\n\n     estate filed on September 25, 2008, included two parcels of farmland identified as TRACT VII\n\n     and TRACT VIII. The inventory documented that Stephen was the owner of record \u201cas trustee\n\n     under the provisions of [Illinois Land Trust 104].\u201d No property other than TRACT VII and\n\n     TRACT VIII was listed as being held in Land Trust 104.\n\n\u00b68           During probate, Stephen, acting as Trustee of Land Trust 104, conveyed Tracts VII and\n\n     VIII from the land trust to the Ficklin Family Trust and recorded that Trustee\u2019s Deed in Iroquois\n\n     County on October 24, 2008. Stephen also appears as grantee trustee in the conveyance. The\n\n     Trustee\u2019s Deed stated that the Land Trust Trustee was granting and conveying the tracts to the\n\n     Family Trust \u201cpursuant to the authority, direction, terms and provisions of the Last Will and\n\n     Testament.\u201d No separate letter of direction was filed 3 nor does one appear in the appeal record.\n\n     In 2009, Stephen filed a final report for Roy's estate. The trial court accepted the report,\n\n     discharged Stephen as executor, and closed Roy\u2019s estate.\n\n\n\n\n             3\n                A letter of direction is a written and signed instrument from the beneficiary of a Land Trust\n     authorizing and directing the Land Trustee to dispose of her beneficial interest in an instructed manner.\n     See Marquette Bank v. Heartland Bank and Trust Co., 2015 IL App (1st) 142627, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17 (describing the\n     effect of the beneficiary\u2019s letter of direction).\n                                                        5\n\f\u00b69            In June 2016, Lucille Ficklin died and in September of that year Stephen, acting as\n\n       fiduciary and Trustee of the Family Trust, deeded the tracts from himself as Trustee to himself\n\n       individually. A year later, respondents learned of the transfer and filed a motion in Lucille\u2019s\n\n       probate proceedings to set aside the deed. The trial court granted their motion by written order on\n\n       January 18, 2018, finding that the tracts were never validly transferred from the Land Trust 104\n\n       to the Family Trust because Stephen, as the holder of the beneficial interest, had not provided\n\n       written direction to the Land Trust trustee (also Stephen) to make the transfer. Consequently, the\n\n       court determined the attempted conveyance had failed and the Family Trust trustee had no tracts\n\n       to convey to Stephen. The court concluded that Land Trust 104 had retained legal title to the\n\n       tracts and they remained in Roy\u2019s estate as non-probated assets. In accord with this decision,\n\n       Stephen filed a petition to reopen Roy\u2019s estate, which the trial court granted on March 5, 2018,\n\n       and reaffirmed on May 3. In the latter order the court stated that it did not \u201csee any reason for an\n\n       evidentiary record\u201d to reopen the estate because \u201can adequate record already [existed] in\u201d\n\n       Lucille\u2019s probate case. The same day, respondents filed an answer and an affirmative defense\n\n       opposing reopening Roy\u2019s estate. They argued laches and estoppel. On June 8, 2018, Stephen\n\n       filed an inventory and final accounting, asserting that the disputed tracts of land were distributed\n\n       to him on April 5, 2018, by warranty deed. He also filed a final report indicating that no new\n\n       inventory was required nor was a final accounting necessary under 755 ILCS 5/28-6. On June 8,\n\n       2018, Stephen filed a receipt showing that he received Tracts VII and VIII as heir and legatee\n\n       under Roy\u2019s Will.\n\n\u00b6 10          On July 20, 2018, Russell and Katherine filed an objection to Stephen's final report,\n\n       arguing that a full accounting of what was occurring in the \u201cnew\u201d probate was required and\n\n       denying that Section 28-6 exonerated Stephen from that responsibility. They also noted that\n\n\n                                                        6\n\f       certain assets that Stephen had previously indicated had been transferred to the Family Trust, as\n\n       legatee, were never identified in the trust accountings. Citing Lambos v. Lambos, 9 Ill. App. 3d\n\n       530 (1972), they contended that no letter of direction was required because, as grantor and\n\n       grantee, Stephen acknowledged and consented to the conveyance of the two tracts. Before the\n\n       trial court held a hearing or ruled on the objection, respondents filed an appeal. There was,\n\n       however, no final order and the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Ficklin v. Kuipers,\n\n       2019 IL App (3d) 180433-U, \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b6 11          Thereafter, respondents renewed their objection to Stephen\u2019s final report, and Stephen\n\n       responded. The trial court, following a hearing, issued a written order on August 12, 2019,\n\n       denying the renewed objection and approving the final report. This order reiterated the major\n\n       factual findings and legal conclusions in the order previously entered in Lucille\u2019s estate on\n\n       January 18, 2018, which had invalidated the transfer of the two tracts, first to the Family Trust\n\n       and later to Stephen, for want of a letter of direction. In the new order, the court also found that\n\n       respondents had no standing to object to the distribution of the real property to Stephen or to the\n\n       final accounting and report of the reopened estate. It further concluded that all issues regarding\n\n       the estate proceedings were precluded under the doctrine of res judicata because respondents\n\n       were attempting to reargue issues already raised when the estate was reopened. Thereafter, the\n\n       court approved the final accounting and report, and closed the estate. Katherine and Russell\n\n       appealed.\n\n\u00b6 12                                               ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 13          In this appeal, respondents seek review of the circuit court\u2019s orders of March 5, 2018;\n\n       May 3, 2018; June 25, 2018; and August 12, 2019. The combined effect of the first three orders\n\n       was to allow Stephen, following a determination by the court that the beneficial interest in Land\n\n\n                                                         7\n\f       Trust 104 had not previously been probated, to reopen Roy\u2019s estate and complete the probate as\n\n       Roy\u2019s executor. The fourth order noted the execution and recording of a warranty deed\n\n       conveying the challenged parcels to Stephen; approved the inventory, final accounting, and\n\n       amended final report, thereby completing the probate; \u201cover-ruled\u201d respondents\u2019 objections to\n\n       the proceedings and to the disposition of the beneficial interest, finding they had no standing, and\n\n       that relitigation of the issues was barred by res judicata; and closed the estate.\n\n\u00b6 14          Respondents identify three issues for our review: (1) was there a valid conveyance of\n\n       farmland from Land Trust 104 to the Ficklin Family Trust in 2008? (2) did the court err in its\n\n       application of 755 ILCS 5/24-9 in reopening Roy\u2019s estate? and (3) did the court err in failing to\n\n       consider or address Stephen\u2019s fiduciary obligations? In addition, as previously noted, the trial\n\n       court did not rule on respondents\u2019 objections, asserting in its August 12, 2019, final order that\n\n       they were barred by issues of standing and res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 15          As we address these issues, we are guided by the principle that the paramount obligation\n\n       of courts in resolving probate challenges is to effectuate the intent of the testator so long as doing\n\n       so does not violate the law or public policy. Stites v. Gray, 4 Ill. 2d 510, 512 (1954). See also In\n\n       re Estate of Lello, 2016 IL App (1st) 142500, \u00b6 15. Here Roy\u2019s intent, and that of his wife\n\n       Lucille, is expressly stated in the wills they planned and executed.\n\n\u00b6 16          The terms of the wills were designed to achieve two interim purposes before ultimately\n\n       completing their single distributive goal. As described by Roy in Article 16, their ultimate intent\n\n       was to bequeath as large a portion of the assets he and Lucille had acquired as possible to their\n\n       three children in shares they had determined were both equitable and just. To that end they\n\n\n\n\n                                                         8\n\f       executed reciprocal wills 4 to ensure their agreed plan would be carried out no matter which of\n\n       them died first. As it happened, Roy was the first to die so the plan to achieve their interim\n\n       purposes unfolded as set out in his will. First, the will initiated a tax-deferral strategy involving\n\n       the creation of sheltering marital and family trusts to minimize the bite federal estate taxes would\n\n       take out of their accumulated assets. The second purpose was to ensure that all the needs of\n\n       Lucille, as the surviving spouse, were met for the balance of her life.\n\n\u00b6 17           Relative to final distribution, the will identified a single specific bequest to each of Roy\u2019s\n\n       children to be theirs alone without possibility of diversion of any of that interest to the other\n\n       siblings. In an apparent effort to preserve as much of the tax-sheltered gift as possible, Roy used\n\n       the property bequeathed to Stephen to generate or augment a stream of income for Lucille\u2019s care,\n\n       so the distribution of his bequest was deferred until her death. Similarly, for Lucille to continue\n\n       to live in the family home and to make decisions relative to it, Katherine\u2019s receipt of her specific\n\n       bequest was also deferred. The authorization to invade principal if necessary for Lucille\u2019s\n\n       continued care and the latitude given Lucille regarding the residence put both bequests at some\n\n       risk of diminution; authorized trusts could help protect these assets so all of Roy\u2019s testamentary\n\n       objectives could be met. Upon Lucille\u2019s death, the distribution directed in Article 2 of Roy\u2019s will\n\n       could finally be completed. Stephen would receive his two tracts of land and Katherine would\n\n       receive the house (or its equivalent). Russell would presumably have already received his\n\n       insurance trust. Everything else remaining in Lucille\u2019s estate would be distributed to the three\n\n       siblings in equal shares, per stirpes. Roy\u2019s intent in this regard is clear and nothing about that\n\n\n\n\n               4\n                Lucille\u2019s will is not in this appeal record, but there has been no representation that it was\n       changed in any way between Roy\u2019s death and hers.\n                                                             9\n\f       intent violates either law or public policy. It is, therefore, front and center in this analysis and\n\n       should be effectuated.\n\n\u00b6 18             Before tackling the issue at the heart of this case, we briefly consider the trial court\u2019s\n\n       conclusions that respondents (1) lacked standing to challenge Stephen\u2019s entitlement to the two\n\n       real estate parcels and (2) were precluded from advancing their arguments by principles of res\n\n       judicata. Regarding standing, respondents have taken the position that transfer of the parcels into\n\n       the Family Trust rendered them subject to equal distribution under Lucille\u2019s will. They thus\n\n       articulate a legally cognizable interest in the property bequeathed to Stephen in Roy\u2019s will. The\n\n       reopening of Roy\u2019s estate and the open status of the very asset they seek gives them standing to\n\n       advance a claim. Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Assn v. County of Cook, 2022 IL\n\n       127126, \u00b6 13 (quoting Greer v. Illinois Housing Development Authority, 122 Ill. 2d 462, 492-93\n\n       (1988).\n\n\u00b6 19             The applicability of res judicata requires unity of issues and of parties and a final\n\n       adjudication on the merits. Hudson v. City of Chicago, 225 Ill. 2d 462, 467 (2008). Stephen, in\n\n       his individual capacity, Katherine, and Russell were parties in both actions. However, Stephen in\n\n       his status as executor served as the voice of the estates of his parents. The Estate of Lucille\n\n       Ficklin and the Estate of Roy Ficklin are different parties and each is integral to the separate\n\n       proceeding in which they appear. The requirement of unity of parties for res judicata is not met.\n\n       Moreover, in reopening Roy\u2019s estate for further action on the very property being sought by\n\n       respondents, despite having issued its first \u201cfinal\u201d order, the trial court cast doubt on its finality.\n\n\u00b6 20             Neither lack of standing nor res judicata bars consideration of respondents\u2019 arguments on\n\n       the merits. The trial court did not address them on the merits and we would normally remand this\n\n       matter for it to do so. However, the ultimate resolution of this case turns on the ascertainment of\n\n\n                                                           10\n\f       the testator\u2019s intent as manifested in the terms of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will\u2014a determination we are as\n\n       well positioned as the trial court to make. We also have authority, pursuant to supreme court rule\n\n       366, to do so and we choose to exercise it in this case. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 366(a)(5) (\u201creviewing\n\n       court may, in its discretion, and on such terms as it deems just, *** enter any judgment, and\n\n       make any order that ought to have been given or made\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 21          The central issue before us in this case is whether the trial court erred when it reopened\n\n       Roy\u2019s estate. At the heart of that issue is the question of whether there was a valid conveyance\n\n       from Land Trust 104 to the Family Trust. We believe that there was. On April 28, 2008, Lucille\n\n       conveyed her 50% beneficial interest in Land Trust 104 to Roy so that he possessed 100% of that\n\n       interest at the time he executed his will, also on that same date. In the will he directed the\n\n       creation of the Family Trust and gave \u201cthe tax-sheltered gift to the trustee to hold as the Family\n\n       Trust.\u201d The tax-sheltered gift included the two parcels of land at issue.\n\n\u00b6 22          Roy\u2019s will was, in fact, the \u201cletter of direction\u201d from the then-holder of the beneficial\n\n       interest to the trustee to convey the tracts to the Family Trust. Roy also instructed in the will that\n\n       Lucille was the sole beneficiary of the Family Trust, thereby directing the trustee that the\n\n       beneficial interest attached to those parcels of land would pass \u201cin like manner\u201d to Lucille. Under\n\n       the terms of the Family Trust and as set out in Article 9, section 9.1 of the will, the beneficial\n\n       interest differed from that in the land trust. While Lucille still received all of the income, she was\n\n       not given the power of direction. Rather, she could, while willing and able, serve as \u201ctrust\n\n       advisor\u201d and instead of being an affirmative manager of the trust assets, she was a check on the\n\n       trustee\u2019s divestment of them.\n\n\u00b6 23          In short, Stephen\u2019s transfer of the property from Land Trust 104 to the Family Trust was\n\n       properly authorized by the owner of the beneficial interest in a written instrument (the will),\n\n\n                                                         11\n\f       which also transferred the beneficial interest to Lucille. That this was also Stephen\u2019s\n\n       understanding of the will is shown by the statement in the Trustee\u2019s deed that the transfer of the\n\n       parcels into the Family Trust was \u201cpursuant to the authority, direction, terms and provisions of\n\n       the Last Will and Testament.\u201d For these reasons, we find the trial court\u2019s conclusion that\n\n       unprobated assets remained in Roy\u2019s estate to be error. Section 24-9 of the Probate Act of 1975\n\n       establishes two limited circumstances when a decedent\u2019s estate may be reopened: (1) when there\n\n       are newly discovered assets; or (2) when there is an unsettled portion of the estate. 755 ILCS\n\n       5/24-9 (2018). Neither of those circumstances exists in this case and the reopening of Roy\u2019s\n\n       estate was also error.\n\n\u00b6 24           Using different reasoning, we have reached the same conclusion that respondents have\n\n       advocated\u2014that the transfer of the property from the Land Trust to the Family Trust was\n\n       effective and there were no remaining or newly discovered unprobated assets in Roy\u2019s estate.\n\n       That fact renders respondents\u2019 other two issues moot. It does not, however, support or strengthen\n\n       their argument that an effective transfer of the two parcels into the Family Trust defeats the\n\n       specific bequest to Stephen and requires the property to be distributed, in equal shares, to all\n\n       three siblings.\n\n\u00b6 25           That argument flies in the face of what we see as a clear and unambiguous directive to\n\n       the contrary. Section 2.4 makes an unequivocal and specific bequest of parcels 1 and 2 to\n\n       Stephen and, if Lucille survives him, delays distribution of that bequest and directs its transfer\n\n       into the Family Trust to help finance Lucille\u2019s care while she lives. In essence, Roy bequeathed\n\n       the parcels to Stephen in fee simple subject to a life interest for Lucille in income they could\n\n       generate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        12\n\f\u00b6 26          That the existence, terms, or operation of the Family Trust neither intended nor effected\n\n       any change in Stephen\u2019s entitlement to sole ownership of the property is evidenced in Roy\u2019s will\n\n       in three ways: FIRST, the use of the phrase \u201c[n]otwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this\n\n       Article,\u201d referencing sections 2.1, 2.2 (a) and (b), and 2.3, to articulate that no matter what else\n\n       was required in those sections, the specific bequest to Stephen would remain in effect; SECOND,\n\n       the caveat after directing the gift that \u201cno portion of which said parcels shall pass to the other\n\n       shares for my remaining children (or their descendants)\u2026.\u201d; and THIRD, the multiple\n\n       unequivocal declarations of his intent appearing elsewhere in the will, but particularly in Article\n\n       16.\n\n\u00b6 27          Based on the actual language of the will and on it multiple affirmative statements of\n\n       Roy\u2019s testamentary intent, we hold that Stephen is solely and individually entitled to the two\n\n       parcels of real property identified in Section 2.4 of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will. We note that a Trustee\u2019s\n\n       Deed was executed and recorded on September 15, 2016 that effectuated the transfer of the two\n\n       parcels from the Family Trust to Stephen Ficklin. However, that deed was set aside by the trial\n\n       court when the Estate of Roy Ficklin was improperly reopened and because we have not been\n\n       asked to review that decision, we lack jurisdiction to reinstate that trustee\u2019s deed. We have\n\n       determined, however, that the trustee of the Family Trust was the proper grantor and as such\n\n       authorize Stephen Ficklin as the trustee of the Family Trust to execute a corrected deed\n\n       conveying the land identified in Section 2.4 of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will to himself, solely and\n\n       individually\n\n\u00b6 28                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 29          For the foregoing reasons, we find it was error to reopen the estate of Roy Ficklin and,\n\n       doubting the validity of actions taken in an unauthorized proceeding, vacate them. We find that it\n\n\n                                                         13\n\f       was the clear, and clearly expressed, intent of Roy Ficklin that the specific bequest to Stephen set\n\n       out in section 2.4 of his Last Will and Testament be and remain effective regardless of whether\n\n       or not Lucille survived him and the Family Trust was established and distributed pursuant to\n\n       Article 4. We validate the legal basis for a warranty deed of the property identified in Section 2.4\n\n       of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will to Stephen, individually, and we authorize Stephen to execute a corrected\n\n       deed from the Family Trust.\n\n\u00b6 30          Judgment vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">          NOTICE: This order was filed under Supreme Court Rule 23 and may not be cited as\n          precedent by any party except in the limited circumstances allowed under Rule 23(e)(1).\n\n                                      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (3d) 190534-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n                                  Order filed July 8, 2022\n     ____________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                                IN THE\n\n                                 APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n                                          THIRD DISTRICT\n\n                                                  2022\n\n     In re ESTATE OF ROY L.

Ficklin because there\n                were no assets, either remaining or newly discovered, to be probated. In\n                conformity with the testator\u2019s intent, Petitioner Stephen Ficklin, individually and\n                solely, is entitled to the contested parcels of real property. We authorize Stephen\n                to execute a corrected deed from the Family Trust.\n\f\u00b62          Petitioner Stephen Ficklin, in response to an order of the trial court granting a motion\n\n     filed by respondents Katherine Kuipers and Russell Ficklin to set aside a deed in which he had\n\n     conveyed two parcels from a Family Trust, of which he was trustee, to himself, sought leave to\n\n     reopen the estate of the parties\u2019 father, Roy L. Ficklin, which had closed eight years earlier. All\n\n     parties are surviving adult children of Roy Ficklin. Over respondents\u2019 objection, the trial court\n\n     granted the petition and allowed Stephen to issue himself a warranty deed for the two tracts of\n\n     land he had transferred to a family trust a year before his father\u2019s estate was closed. Thereafter,\n\n     Stephen filed an inventory, final accounting, and final report in Roy\u2019s reopened estate. The trial\n\n     court accepted the final report and closed the estate over Respondents\u2019 objection. Katherine and\n\n     Russell have appealed.\n\n\u00b63                                                 FACTS\n\n\u00b64          Roy L. Ficklin, a long time Illinois farmer, died testate on May 24, 2008, in Iroquois\n\n     County. He was survived by his wife, Lucille, and his three adult children, Stephen, Katherine,\n\n     and Russell. Roy's will included provisions directing gifts and distributions of property to his\n\n     wife and children with variations depending on whether or not Lucille survived him. Stephen\n\n     was designated as the estate\u2019s executor and administrator. The will, which is quite long and\n\n     detailed, contained four major distributive provisions pertinent to this appeal. One of those\n\n     provisions makes the terms of a specific land trust relevant as well.\n\n\u00b65          In Article 2 of the will, entitled \u201cGifts on My Death,\u201d Roy made the following bequests:\n\n            A. All his tangible personal property, which is specifically defined in section 2.1,\n\n                to Lucille because she survived him.\n\n            B. The \u201ctax-sheltered gift\u201d to a trustee to hold as a Family Trust. The administration and\n\n                distribution of the assets of this trust on termination were described in Article 4. The\n\n\n                                                       2\n\f      \u201ctax-sheltered gift\u201d was defined in Article 14, section 14.11 and it included, but was\n\n      not limited to, two parcels of real estate held in Land Trust 104. The Family Trust\n\n      section provided for payment of all income to Lucille, for potential invasion of\n\n      principal if necessary for her health and maintenance, and, upon her death, for\n\n      termination of the trust and distribution of its assets to the living children, per stirpes,\n\n      in equal shares.\n\nC. The \u201cbalance of [the] estate\u201d to a trustee to hold as a Marital Trust. The\n\n      administration and distribution of the trust assets in equal shares, per stirpes, on its\n\n      termination were described in Article 3. The \u201cbalance of the estate\u201d is defined in\n\n      Article 14, section 14.1.1 Stephen was named trustee of both the Family Trust and\n\n      Marital Trust, with Katherine and Russell identified as potential successors if Stephen\n\n      failed to so act.\n\nD. Certain specific bequests which \u201cshall be added\u201d to the distribution of each child\u2019s\n\n      share \u201cnotwithstanding the foregoing provisions\u201d (described in A \u2013 C above):\n\n      (1) to Stephen (section 2.4) two specifically identified parcels of real property.\n\n          Roy stated that \u201cno portion of [those] parcels shall pass to the other shares for my\n\n          remaining children (or their descendants).\u201d He acknowledged that this addition to\n\n          Stephen\u2019s otherwise-equal share would result in the passing of unequal shares to\n\n          his children. Because these parcels were included in Land Trust 104, the will\n\n          directed that \u201call interest in the beneficial interest therein and power of direction\n\n          thereover\u201d should pass the same way the parcels did.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    No \u201cbalance\u201d remained after the creation of the Family Trust, so this trust was never created.\n                                               3\n\f            (2) to Katherine (section 2.5) the residence on East Lincoln in Onarga, Illinois. As\n\n                with Stephen\u2019s bequest, Roy stated that the other two children and their\n\n                descendants should have no interest in this bequest to Katherine. He also\n\n                acknowledged that this addition to Katherine\u2019s otherwise-equal share would result\n\n                in the passing of unequal shares to his children. 2\n\n            (3) to Russell (section 2.6) there was no bequest of real property, however he would\n\n                receive, presumably solely, the benefits of the Roy F. Ficklin Irrevocable Life\n\n                Insurance Trust.\n\n        E. The will also contained an Article 16, entitled \u201cStatement of Purpose and Estate\n\n            Planning Agreement\u201d in which Roy described, clearly and in significant detail, the\n\n            time and thought he and Lucille had put into determining how their assets should be\n\n            divided among their children and the care they had taken to discuss with the children,\n\n            as a family unit, the decisions they had made and the reasons for them. He referenced\n\n            their need to balance their business responsibilities to Stephen with their personal\n\n            desire to treat all of their children both fairly and equally. He asked that the children\n\n            respect, understand, and appreciate their arrangements as expressions of love for all\n\n            of them and that they maintain and grow their familial relationships. He further stated\n\n            that, to ensure that their intentions would take effect, he and Lucille had executed\n\n            reciprocal wills, had agreed that neither of them, while they both lived, would make\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           In Article 15, seemingly to ensure protection of this bequest even while Lucille continued to live\nin the residence, Roy authorized, but did not require, his executor to put the residence in yet another trust\nproviding that, no matter what Lucille elected to do with it, that residence, any replacement residence, or\nthe proceeds of any sale would remain sheltered for Katherine.\n                                                     4\n\f                 any changes, and had provided that any changes after the death of one of them \u201cmay\n\n                 only be taken with the written consent of all three of our then living children\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00b66           Roy\u2019s will was executed April 28, 2008. On that same day Lucille transferred her 50%\n\n     beneficial interest in Land Trust 104 to Roy. Less than a month later, on May 24, 2008, Roy\n\n     died. At the time of his death, he owned 100% of that beneficial interest.\n\n\u00b67           On June 20, 2008, Stephen filed a petition to begin the probate of his father's estate in\n\n     Iroquois County. The Will was admitted to probate with Stephen appearing both as\n\n     representative/administrator of Roy\u2019s estate and individually as an heir. An inventory of the\n\n     estate filed on September 25, 2008, included two parcels of farmland identified as TRACT VII\n\n     and TRACT VIII. The inventory documented that Stephen was the owner of record \u201cas trustee\n\n     under the provisions of [Illinois Land Trust 104].\u201d No property other than TRACT VII and\n\n     TRACT VIII was listed as being held in Land Trust 104.\n\n\u00b68           During probate, Stephen, acting as Trustee of Land Trust 104, conveyed Tracts VII and\n\n     VIII from the land trust to the Ficklin Family Trust and recorded that Trustee\u2019s Deed in Iroquois\n\n     County on October 24, 2008. Stephen also appears as grantee trustee in the conveyance. The\n\n     Trustee\u2019s Deed stated that the Land Trust Trustee was granting and conveying the tracts to the\n\n     Family Trust \u201cpursuant to the authority, direction, terms and provisions of the Last Will and\n\n     Testament.\u201d No separate letter of direction was filed 3 nor does one appear in the appeal record.\n\n     In 2009, Stephen filed a final report for Roy's estate. The trial court accepted the report,\n\n     discharged Stephen as executor, and closed Roy\u2019s estate.\n\n\n\n\n             3\n                A letter of direction is a written and signed instrument from the beneficiary of a Land Trust\n     authorizing and directing the Land Trustee to dispose of her beneficial interest in an instructed manner.\n     See Marquette Bank v. Heartland Bank and Trust Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2015 IL App (1st) 142627</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17 (describing the\n     effect of the beneficiary\u2019s letter of direction).\n                                                        5\n\f\u00b69            In June 2016, Lucille Ficklin died and in September of that year Stephen, acting as\n\n       fiduciary and Trustee of the Family Trust, deeded the tracts from himself as Trustee to himself\n\n       individually. A year later, respondents learned of the transfer and filed a motion in Lucille\u2019s\n\n       probate proceedings to set aside the deed. The trial court granted their motion by written order on\n\n       January 18, 2018, finding that the tracts were never validly transferred from the Land Trust 104\n\n       to the Family Trust because Stephen, as the holder of the beneficial interest, had not provided\n\n       written direction to the Land Trust trustee (also Stephen) to make the transfer. Consequently, the\n\n       court determined the attempted conveyance had failed and the Family Trust trustee had no tracts\n\n       to convey to Stephen. The court concluded that Land Trust 104 had retained legal title to the\n\n       tracts and they remained in Roy\u2019s estate as non-probated assets. In accord with this decision,\n\n       Stephen filed a petition to reopen Roy\u2019s estate, which the trial court granted on March 5, 2018,\n\n       and reaffirmed on May 3. In the latter order the court stated that it did not \u201csee any reason for an\n\n       evidentiary record\u201d to reopen the estate because \u201can adequate record already [existed] in\u201d\n\n       Lucille\u2019s probate case. The same day, respondents filed an answer and an affirmative defense\n\n       opposing reopening Roy\u2019s estate. They argued laches and estoppel. On June 8, 2018, Stephen\n\n       filed an inventory and final accounting, asserting that the disputed tracts of land were distributed\n\n       to him on April 5, 2018, by warranty deed. He also filed a final report indicating that no new\n\n       inventory was required nor was a final accounting necessary under 755 ILCS 5/28-6. On June 8,\n\n       2018, Stephen filed a receipt showing that he received Tracts VII and VIII as heir and legatee\n\n       under Roy\u2019s Will.\n\n\u00b6 10          On July 20, 2018, Russell and Katherine filed an objection to Stephen's final report,\n\n       arguing that a full accounting of what was occurring in the \u201cnew\u201d probate was required and\n\n       denying that Section 28-6 exonerated Stephen from that responsibility.

Before the\n\n       trial court held a hearing or ruled on the objection, respondents filed an appeal. There was,\n\n       however, no final order and the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Ficklin v. Kuipers,\n\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019 IL App (3d) 180433-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b6 11          Thereafter, respondents renewed their objection to Stephen\u2019s final report, and Stephen\n\n       responded. The trial court, following a hearing, issued a written order on August 12, 2019,\n\n       denying the renewed objection and approving the final report. This order reiterated the major\n\n       factual findings and legal conclusions in the order previously entered in Lucille\u2019s estate on\n\n       January 18, 2018, which had invalidated the transfer of the two tracts, first to the Family Trust\n\n       and later to Stephen, for want of a letter of direction. In the new order, the court also found that\n\n       respondents had no standing to object to the distribution of the real property to Stephen or to the\n\n       final accounting and report of the reopened estate. It further concluded that all issues regarding\n\n       the estate proceedings were precluded under the doctrine of res judicata because respondents\n\n       were attempting to reargue issues already raised when the estate was reopened. Thereafter, the\n\n       court approved the final accounting and report, and closed the estate. Katherine and Russell\n\n       appealed.\n\n\u00b6 12                                               ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 13          In this appeal, respondents seek review of the circuit court\u2019s orders of March 5, 2018;\n\n       May 3, 2018; June 25, 2018; and August 12, 2019. The combined effect of the first three orders\n\n       was to allow Stephen, following a determination by the court that the beneficial interest in Land\n\n\n                                                         7\n\f       Trust 104 had not previously been probated, to reopen Roy\u2019s estate and complete the probate as\n\n       Roy\u2019s executor. The fourth order noted the execution and recording of a warranty deed\n\n       conveying the challenged parcels to Stephen; approved the inventory, final accounting, and\n\n       amended final report, thereby completing the probate; \u201cover-ruled\u201d respondents\u2019 objections to\n\n       the proceedings and to the disposition of the beneficial interest, finding they had no standing, and\n\n       that relitigation of the issues was barred by res judicata; and closed the estate.\n\n\u00b6 14          Respondents identify three issues for our review: (1) was there a valid conveyance of\n\n       farmland from Land Trust 104 to the Ficklin Family Trust in 2008? (2) did the court err in its\n\n       application of 755 ILCS 5/24-9 in reopening Roy\u2019s estate? and (3) did the court err in failing to\n\n       consider or address Stephen\u2019s fiduciary obligations? In addition, as previously noted, the trial\n\n       court did not rule on respondents\u2019 objections, asserting in its August 12, 2019, final order that\n\n       they were barred by issues of standing and res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 15          As we address these issues, we are guided by the principle that the paramount obligation\n\n       of courts in resolving probate challenges is to effectuate the intent of the testator so long as doing\n\n       so does not violate the law or public policy.

Here Roy\u2019s intent, and that of his wife\n\n       Lucille, is expressly stated in the wills they planned and executed.\n\n\u00b6 16          The terms of the wills were designed to achieve two interim purposes before ultimately\n\n       completing their single distributive goal. As described by Roy in Article 16, their ultimate intent\n\n       was to bequeath as large a portion of the assets he and Lucille had acquired as possible to their\n\n       three children in shares they had determined were both equitable and just. To that end they\n\n\n\n\n                                                         8\n\f       executed reciprocal wills 4 to ensure their agreed plan would be carried out no matter which of\n\n       them died first. As it happened, Roy was the first to die so the plan to achieve their interim\n\n       purposes unfolded as set out in his will. First, the will initiated a tax-deferral strategy involving\n\n       the creation of sheltering marital and family trusts to minimize the bite federal estate taxes would\n\n       take out of their accumulated assets. The second purpose was to ensure that all the needs of\n\n       Lucille, as the surviving spouse, were met for the balance of her life.\n\n\u00b6 17           Relative to final distribution, the will identified a single specific bequest to each of Roy\u2019s\n\n       children to be theirs alone without possibility of diversion of any of that interest to the other\n\n       siblings. In an apparent effort to preserve as much of the tax-sheltered gift as possible, Roy used\n\n       the property bequeathed to Stephen to generate or augment a stream of income for Lucille\u2019s care,\n\n       so the distribution of his bequest was deferred until her death. Similarly, for Lucille to continue\n\n       to live in the family home and to make decisions relative to it, Katherine\u2019s receipt of her specific\n\n       bequest was also deferred. The authorization to invade principal if necessary for Lucille\u2019s\n\n       continued care and the latitude given Lucille regarding the residence put both bequests at some\n\n       risk of diminution; authorized trusts could help protect these assets so all of Roy\u2019s testamentary\n\n       objectives could be met. Upon Lucille\u2019s death, the distribution directed in Article 2 of Roy\u2019s will\n\n       could finally be completed. Stephen would receive his two tracts of land and Katherine would\n\n       receive the house (or its equivalent). Russell would presumably have already received his\n\n       insurance trust. Everything else remaining in Lucille\u2019s estate would be distributed to the three\n\n       siblings in equal shares, per stirpes. Roy\u2019s intent in this regard is clear and nothing about that\n\n\n\n\n               4\n                Lucille\u2019s will is not in this appeal record, but there has been no representation that it was\n       changed in any way between Roy\u2019s death and hers.\n                                                             9\n\f       intent violates either law or public policy. It is, therefore, front and center in this analysis and\n\n       should be effectuated.\n\n\u00b6 18             Before tackling the issue at the heart of this case, we briefly consider the trial court\u2019s\n\n       conclusions that respondents (1) lacked standing to challenge Stephen\u2019s entitlement to the two\n\n       real estate parcels and (2) were precluded from advancing their arguments by principles of res\n\n       judicata. Regarding standing, respondents have taken the position that transfer of the parcels into\n\n       the Family Trust rendered them subject to equal distribution under Lucille\u2019s will. They thus\n\n       articulate a legally cognizable interest in the property bequeathed to Stephen in Roy\u2019s will. The\n\n       reopening of Roy\u2019s estate and the open status of the very asset they seek gives them standing to\n\n       advance a claim. Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Assn v.

Stephen, in\n\n       his individual capacity, Katherine, and Russell were parties in both actions. However, Stephen in\n\n       his status as executor served as the voice of the estates of his parents. The Estate of Lucille\n\n       Ficklin and the Estate of Roy Ficklin are different parties and each is integral to the separate\n\n       proceeding in which they appear. The requirement of unity of parties for res judicata is not met.\n\n       Moreover, in reopening Roy\u2019s estate for further action on the very property being sought by\n\n       respondents, despite having issued its first \u201cfinal\u201d order, the trial court cast doubt on its finality.\n\n\u00b6 20             Neither lack of standing nor res judicata bars consideration of respondents\u2019 arguments on\n\n       the merits. The trial court did not address them on the merits and we would normally remand this\n\n       matter for it to do so. However, the ultimate resolution of this case turns on the ascertainment of\n\n\n                                                           10\n\f       the testator\u2019s intent as manifested in the terms of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will\u2014a determination we are as\n\n       well positioned as the trial court to make. We also have authority, pursuant to supreme court rule\n\n       366, to do so and we choose to exercise it in this case. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 366(a)(5) (\u201creviewing\n\n       court may, in its discretion, and on such terms as it deems just, *** enter any judgment, and\n\n       make any order that ought to have been given or made\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 21          The central issue before us in this case is whether the trial court erred when it reopened\n\n       Roy\u2019s estate. At the heart of that issue is the question of whether there was a valid conveyance\n\n       from Land Trust 104 to the Family Trust. We believe that there was. On April 28, 2008, Lucille\n\n       conveyed her 50% beneficial interest in Land Trust 104 to Roy so that he possessed 100% of that\n\n       interest at the time he executed his will, also on that same date. In the will he directed the\n\n       creation of the Family Trust and gave \u201cthe tax-sheltered gift to the trustee to hold as the Family\n\n       Trust.\u201d The tax-sheltered gift included the two parcels of land at issue.\n\n\u00b6 22          Roy\u2019s will was, in fact, the \u201cletter of direction\u201d from the then-holder of the beneficial\n\n       interest to the trustee to convey the tracts to the Family Trust. Roy also instructed in the will that\n\n       Lucille was the sole beneficiary of the Family Trust, thereby directing the trustee that the\n\n       beneficial interest attached to those parcels of land would pass \u201cin like manner\u201d to Lucille. Under\n\n       the terms of the Family Trust and as set out in Article 9, section 9.1 of the will, the beneficial\n\n       interest differed from that in the land trust. While Lucille still received all of the income, she was\n\n       not given the power of direction. Rather, she could, while willing and able, serve as \u201ctrust\n\n       advisor\u201d and instead of being an affirmative manager of the trust assets, she was a check on the\n\n       trustee\u2019s divestment of them.\n\n\u00b6 23          In short, Stephen\u2019s transfer of the property from Land Trust 104 to the Family Trust was\n\n       properly authorized by the owner of the beneficial interest in a written instrument (the will),\n\n\n                                                         11\n\f       which also transferred the beneficial interest to Lucille. That this was also Stephen\u2019s\n\n       understanding of the will is shown by the statement in the Trustee\u2019s deed that the transfer of the\n\n       parcels into the Family Trust was \u201cpursuant to the authority, direction, terms and provisions of\n\n       the Last Will and Testament.\u201d For these reasons, we find the trial court\u2019s conclusion that\n\n       unprobated assets remained in Roy\u2019s estate to be error. Section 24-9 of the Probate Act of 1975\n\n       establishes two limited circumstances when a decedent\u2019s estate may be reopened: (1) when there\n\n       are newly discovered assets; or (2) when there is an unsettled portion of the estate. 755 ILCS\n\n       5/24-9 (2018). Neither of those circumstances exists in this case and the reopening of Roy\u2019s\n\n       estate was also error.\n\n\u00b6 24           Using different reasoning, we have reached the same conclusion that respondents have\n\n       advocated\u2014that the transfer of the property from the Land Trust to the Family Trust was\n\n       effective and there were no remaining or newly discovered unprobated assets in Roy\u2019s estate.\n\n       That fact renders respondents\u2019 other two issues moot. It does not, however, support or strengthen\n\n       their argument that an effective transfer of the two parcels into the Family Trust defeats the\n\n       specific bequest to Stephen and requires the property to be distributed, in equal shares, to all\n\n       three siblings.\n\n\u00b6 25           That argument flies in the face of what we see as a clear and unambiguous directive to\n\n       the contrary. Section 2.4 makes an unequivocal and specific bequest of parcels 1 and 2 to\n\n       Stephen and, if Lucille survives him, delays distribution of that bequest and directs its transfer\n\n       into the Family Trust to help finance Lucille\u2019s care while she lives. In essence, Roy bequeathed\n\n       the parcels to Stephen in fee simple subject to a life interest for Lucille in income they could\n\n       generate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        12\n\f\u00b6 26          That the existence, terms, or operation of the Family Trust neither intended nor effected\n\n       any change in Stephen\u2019s entitlement to sole ownership of the property is evidenced in Roy\u2019s will\n\n       in three ways: FIRST, the use of the phrase \u201c[n]otwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this\n\n       Article,\u201d referencing sections 2.1, 2.2 (a) and (b), and 2.3, to articulate that no matter what else\n\n       was required in those sections, the specific bequest to Stephen would remain in effect; SECOND,\n\n       the caveat after directing the gift that \u201cno portion of which said parcels shall pass to the other\n\n       shares for my remaining children (or their descendants)\u2026.\u201d; and THIRD, the multiple\n\n       unequivocal declarations of his intent appearing elsewhere in the will, but particularly in Article\n\n       16.\n\n\u00b6 27          Based on the actual language of the will and on it multiple affirmative statements of\n\n       Roy\u2019s testamentary intent, we hold that Stephen is solely and individually entitled to the two\n\n       parcels of real property identified in Section 2.4 of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will. We note that a Trustee\u2019s\n\n       Deed was executed and recorded on September 15, 2016 that effectuated the transfer of the two\n\n       parcels from the Family Trust to Stephen Ficklin. However, that deed was set aside by the trial\n\n       court when the Estate of Roy Ficklin was improperly reopened and because we have not been\n\n       asked to review that decision, we lack jurisdiction to reinstate that trustee\u2019s deed. We have\n\n       determined, however, that the trustee of the Family Trust was the proper grantor and as such\n\n       authorize Stephen Ficklin as the trustee of the Family Trust to execute a corrected deed\n\n       conveying the land identified in Section 2.4 of Roy Ficklin\u2019s will to himself, solely and\n\n       individually\n\n\u00b6 28                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 29          For the foregoing reasons, we find it was error to reopen the estate of Roy Ficklin and,\n\n       doubting the validity of actions taken in an unauthorized proceeding, vacate them.

(born May 2011) and J.R. (born July 2009). In May 2020, the State filed\n\na petition for adjudication of wardship, alleging (1) J.A. and J.R. were neglected, (2) Kayla L. was\n\ntheir mother, and (3) Scott R. was their putative father. (The petition alleged that respondent was\n\nthe putative father of two other minors who are not the subject of this appeal.) That same day, the\n\ntrial court ordered paternity testing of J.A. and J.R. In June 2020, DNA test results were filed with\n\nthe court showing that Scott R. was the biological father of J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b63              In August 2020, the trial court adjudicated J.A. and J.R. neglected. In July 2021,\n\nthe State filed a motion to terminate the parental rights of Kayla L. and Scott R. In November\n\f2021, before the termination proceedings were held, the guardian ad litem (GAL) filed a \u201cMotion\n\nfor Declaration of Non-Existence of the Parent Child Relationship and Determination of Paternity\u201d\n\nas to J.A. and J.R., which sought to invalidate the VAPs signed by respondent as to those two\n\nminors. In January 2022, the trial court granted the GAL\u2019s motion and discharged respondent as a\n\nparty to the proceedings.\n\n\u00b64             Respondent appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by (1) applying section 205\n\nof the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015 (Act) (750 ILCS 46/205 (West 2020)) rather than section 309\n\nof the Act (id. \u00a7 309) when determining the GAL\u2019s motion to declare the nonexistence of a\n\nparent-child relationship between respondent and J.A. and J.R. and (2) granting the GAL\u2019s motion\n\nbecause the GAL did not meet the requirements of section 309 that she (a) designate her motion a\n\n\u201cpetition\u201d and (b) make a showing of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. Respondent argues\n\nin the alternative that, if the court was correct to apply section 205, the GAL\u2019s motion still fails\n\nbecause she did not designate her motion a \u201cpetition.\u201d We conclude that respondent has forfeited\n\nthese arguments by failing to raise them in the trial court and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\u00b65                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b66                                     A. Procedural History\n\n\u00b67                           1. The Petition and Adjudicatory Hearing\n\n\u00b68             In May 2020, the State filed a petition for adjudication of wardship, alleging J.A.\n\n(born May 2011), and J.R. (born July 2009), were neglected in that their environment was injurious\n\nto their welfare when they resided with (1) their mother, Kayla L., due to her \u201cunresolved issues\n\nof domestic violence and/or anger management\u201d and \u201calcohol and/or substance abuse\u201d and\n\n(2) their putative father, Scott R., due to his \u201cunresolved issues of domestic violence and/or anger\n\nmanagement.\u201d 705 ILCS 405/2-3(1)(b) (West 2020). (We note respondent was not named as a\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fputative father of J.A. and J.R. Respondent was included in the petition as the putative father of\n\ntwo other children he shared with Kayla L., namely R.A. (born September 2015) and K.A. (born\n\nOctober 2013).)\n\n\u00b69             That same day, the trial court conducted a shelter care hearing and placed temporary\n\ncustody of the minors with the guardianship administrator of DCFS. The court also entered an\n\norder for paternity testing of J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b6 10           In June 2020, the results of DNA testing were filed with the court, showing Scott\n\nR. was the biological father of J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b6 11           In August 2020, the trial court conducted an adjudicatory hearing and adjudicated\n\nJ.A. and J.R. neglected.\n\n\u00b6 12                                2. The Dispositional Hearing\n\n\u00b6 13           In October 2020, the trial court conducted a dispositional hearing and entered a\n\nwritten order finding Kayla L. and Scott R. to be unfit for reasons other than financial\n\ncircumstances alone to care for, protect, train, educate, supervise, or discipline J.A. and J.R. and\n\nthat placement with Kayla L. or Scott R. would be contrary to the health, safety, and best interests\n\nof J.A. and J.R. The court placed custody and guardianship of J.A. and J.R. with the guardianship\n\nadministrator of DCFS and set the permanency goal as \u201creturn home [in] 12 months.\u201d (We note\n\nthat, at the same hearing, the court found respondent fit as to R.A. and K.A. and awarded him\n\ncustody. At the next hearing, the court awarded respondent guardianship of R.A. and K.A.,\n\nterminated their wardship, and closed their portion of the case.)\n\n\u00b6 14                       3. The Voluntary Acknowledgements of Paternity\n\n\u00b6 15           In July 2021, caseworker Natasha Bever of the Center for Youth and Family\n\nSolutions (CYFS) filed a permanency report regarding J.A. and J.R. In her report, Bever wrote that\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fshe had \u201creceived two separate [VAPs] indicating [respondent] is the legal father of [J.R. and\n\nJ.A.].\u201d Bever further reported that she had spoken to a worker in the child support division who\n\nadvised that \u201cwhile there are paternity results as well as an order in a previous family court case\n\ninvolving [Scott R. and J.R.], there is very specific language that would need to be used in a court\n\nmotion to vacate the VAPs and that has never been completed.\u201d Bever attached the VAPs to her\n\nreport. The VAPs demonstrated that respondent executed and filed a VAP as to J.A. in May 2011\n\nand a VAP as to J.R. in July 2009.\n\n\u00b6 16                              4. The Termination Proceedings\n\n\u00b6 17           Later in July 2021, the State filed a motion for termination of Kayla L. and Scott\n\nR.\u2019s parental rights as to J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b6 18           In September 2021, the trial court entered an order finding Kayla L. and Scott R.\n\nunfit for failing to make reasonable progress toward the return home of the minors during the\n\nnine-month period alleged in the motion to terminate parental rights.\n\n\u00b6 19           In November 2021, Bever filed a best-interest report with the trial court. In the\n\n\u201cRecommendations\u201d section of her report, she requested that the parental rights of Kayla L. and\n\n\u201cbiological father\u201d Scott R. be terminated and also that the parental rights of \u201clegal father,\u201d\n\nrespondent, be terminated.\n\n\u00b6 20           B. The Motion to Declare the Non-Existence of Parent-Child Relationship\n\n\u00b6 21                                       1. The Motion\n\n\u00b6 22           Later in November 2021, the GAL filed a \u201cMotion for Declaration of\n\nNon-Existence of the Parent Child Relationship and Determination of Paternity.\u201d The motion\n\nalleged that (1) J.A. and J.R. were born when respondent and Kayla L. were in a relationship and\n\n(2) respondent signed voluntary acknowledgements of paternity for each minor. The motion\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\ffurther alleged that, as part of the present case, Scott R. was determined to be the biological father\n\nof J.A. and J.R. Accordingly, the motion alleged, \u201cit is in [J.A. and J.R.\u2019s] best interest to identify\n\ntheir genetic father and for them to have only one father. It is not in [J.A. and J.R.\u2019s] best interest\n\nthat [respondent] be designated the legal father based on the [VAP].\u201d The motion requested,\n\ntherefore, that the court \u201cdeclare the non-existence of the father and child relationship between\n\n[respondent and J.A. and J.R.] and declar[e] [Scott R.] is the biological father of [J.A. and J.R.]\n\nand that [respondent] be removed as a part[y] to this proceeding.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 23                               2. The Hearing on the Motion\n\n\u00b6 24           In January 2022, the trial court conducted a hearing on the GAL\u2019s motion. At the\n\nbeginning of the hearing, respondent, through his counsel, asked the court to find that the GAL\u2019s\n\nmotion was facially void because it cited to a section of a repealed version of the Illinois Parentage\n\nAct (750 ILCS 45/11(f)(3) (West 2014) (repealed by Pub. Act 99-85, \u00a7 977 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016))).\n\nThe GAL asked for leave to amend the motion to (1) strike paragraph six, which cited to language\n\nfrom the repealed statute regarding a presumption of paternity based on DNA testing and (2) add\n\nto paragraph five a citation to section 205 of the current version of the Act (750 ILCS 46/205 (West\n\n2020)). The court granted the GAL\u2019s oral motion to amend and clarified that the proceedings\n\n\u201cregarding the non-existence of the parentage relationship\u201d would be held pursuant to section 205.\n\nRespondent did not object to the motion to amend or the court\u2019s proceeding under section 205.\n\n\u00b6 25                                 a. The Evidence Presented\n\n\u00b6 26           Next, the GAL requested the trial court take judicial notice of (1) the DNA results\n\nfiled in June 2020, showing, with a probability of 99.99%, that Scott R. was the father of J.A. and\n\nJ.R., (2) an order of paternity entered by the court in July 2020, naming Scott R. as the father of\n\nJ.A. and J.R., based on the DNA results, and (3) the VAPs executed by respondent as to J.A. and\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fJ.R. in 2011 and 2009, respectively. The court took judicial notice of the requested documents\n\nwithout objection by respondent. No other evidence was presented by any party.\n\n\u00b6 27                              b. The Arguments of the Parties\n\n\u00b6 28           The GAL then argued that, based on the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in In re\n\nA.A., 2015 IL 118605, 43 N.E.3d 947, \u201cbefore you can argue whether or not it\u2019s in the best interest\n\nof the minor for there to be an order declaring non-existence of the parent child relationship, you\n\nmust first *** either establish paternity or disestablish paternity.\u201d The GAL further argued that,\n\nbased on the documents the trial court judicially noticed, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that paternity has already\n\nbeen established. The father of these boys is [Scott R.], is not [respondent].\u201d The GAL asked the\n\ncourt to \u201cvacate the VAPs that were filed previously\u201d and \u201center an order disestablishing paternity\n\nbetween each of these boys and [respondent].\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29           Respondent argued that the issue before the trial court was \u201cwhether or not there\n\nexists a parent child relationship in this case between [respondent and J.A. and J.R.]\u201d Respondent\n\nasserted it was clear that respondent was a father to the boys \u201cin all ways that matter,\u201d noting that\n\nrespondent was in the hospital at their birth, raised them, took them to practices, helped with\n\nschoolwork, and took care of their \u201cactivities of daily living.\u201d Respondent also argued that when\n\nhe signed the VAPs, he voluntarily assumed responsibility of being a parent to the children and\n\nagreed to forego any further inquiry into whether or not he was the children\u2019s biological father.\n\nRespondent continued, \u201cAnd, just as it would be unreasonable to allow [respondent] later based\n\nsolely on DNA to get out of that responsibility, *** this court should not grant the [GAL\u2019s] motion\n\nto basically have a termination hearing through this motion where the burden is different.\u201d\n\nRespondent then argued that pursuant to section 204(b) of the Act (720 ILCS 46/204(b) (West\n\n2020)), if conflicting presumptions of paternity arose under section 204, the court could resolve\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fthat conflict by considering the minors\u2019 best interests. Respondent claimed it would be contrary to\n\nJ.A. and J.R.\u2019s best interests to vacate the VAPs and \u201cmake [them] orphans.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30                                c. The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n\n\u00b6 31           Following the arguments of the parties, the trial court observed that A.A. \u201cuses the\n\nold statutory provisions,\u201d but \u201cwe know the Parentage Act controls.\u201d The court observed that\n\nsection 205(c) of the Act permits the court to \u201cdirect the mother, child and alleged father to submit\n\nto DNA tests to determine inherited characteristics.\u201d The court noted that it ordered such testing,\n\nand the results were on file in this case, showing that Scott R. \u201ccannot be excluded as the biological\n\nfather of the children.\u201d The court continued as follows:\n\n                       \u201c[W]hile there is a voluntary acknowledgement that has been signed by\n\n               [respondent], *** we now have DNA testing that shows [respondent] is not the\n\n               biological father, because [Scott R.] has been established as the father. Orders were\n\n               entered in this court [in July 2020] as referred by [the GAL.] There was no dispute\n\n               made of the DNA tests at the time or objections to the entry of those orders.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 32           The trial court further noted that the birth certificates of J.A. and J.R., which were\n\non record in the present case, showed respondent as the father of J.A. and Scott R. as the father of\n\nJ.R. As a result, the court observed, there were inconsistencies in the birth certificates and the\n\nVAPs and \u201cthis is a legal determination that needs to be made.\u201d The court stated as follows:\n\n                       \u201c[The] Parentage Act contains no express requirement that a court consider\n\n               the best interest of the child before any testing is conducted or a legal determination\n\n               of paternity is made. The first step in the proceeding is to establish or disestablish\n\n               parentage. And that\u2019s what we did in this case. We established that [Scott R.] was\n\n               the father of these children. Once parentage has been established, then the trial court\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f               is charged with the responsibility of deciding other issues which surround paternity,\n\n               including custody and visitation, issues that we may take up in the context of this\n\n               JA case.\n\n                       So the first step is paternity, and that\u2019s been done, and [Scott R.] is the\n\n               father. [Respondent] is not, based upon those results. So, I think [the GAL] has\n\n               established in her motion that there is no, I don\u2019t want to say no relationship, but\n\n               there is no\u2014we have a legal\u2014we have a biological father, and that\u2019s been\n\n               established. That\u2019s sufficient enough based upon case law in looking at this legal\n\n               issue to disestablish or determine the non-existence of [respondent\u2019s] relationship\n\n               with these two children.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 33           On this basis, the trial court granted the GAL\u2019s motion.\n\n\u00b6 34           That same day, the trial court also entered a written order granting the GAL\u2019s\n\nmotion. The court found that respondent \u201cwas designated the legal father of the minor[s] based in\n\n[sic] his execution of Voluntary Acknowledgements of Paternity whereby he claimed to be the\n\nminors\u2019 biological father,\u201d but in July 2020, \u201cthis court found that [Scott R.] was the biological\n\nfather of the minors.\u201d As a result, the court found, respondent \u201cis not the legal father [of J.A. and\n\nJ.R.] and that the VAPs are null and void and he is discharged as a party.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 35           This appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 36                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 37           Respondent appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by (1) applying section 205\n\nof the Act (750 ILCS 46/205 (West 2020)) rather than section 309 of the Act (id. \u00a7 309) when\n\ndetermining the GAL\u2019s motion to declare the nonexistence of a parent-child relationship between\n\nrespondent and J.A. and J.R. and (2) granting the GAL\u2019s motion because the GAL did not meet\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\fthe requirements of section 309 that (a) she designate her motion a \u201cpetition\u201d and (b) make a\n\nshowing of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. Respondent argues in the alternative that, if\n\nthe court was correct to apply section 205, the GAL\u2019s motion still fails because she did not\n\ndesignate her motion a \u201cpetition.\u201d We conclude that respondent has forfeited these arguments by\n\nfailing to raise them in the trial court and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\u00b6 38           \u201cTo preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must, even in child custody\n\ncases, object at trial and file a written posttrial motion addressing it.\u201d In re Chance H., 2019 IL\n\nApp (1st) 180053, \u00b6 45, 139 N.E.3d 88. In the present case, respondent did not raise any of the\n\nissues he brings on appeal at any time before the trial court\u2014neither at the hearing on the GAL\u2019s\n\nmotion nor in a postjudgment motion. Because respondent is raising these issues for the first time\n\non appeal, review of the issues is forfeited. Id.\n\n\u00b6 39           We note that respondent did not merely forfeit his argument by failing to argue in\n\nthe trial court that section 309 of the Act controls, but, instead, stood silent when the court\n\npermitted the GAL to amend its motion to seek invalidation of the VAPs pursuant to section 205.\n\nFurther, respondent argued to the trial court that section 204 applied to the extent competing\n\npresumptions existed, which he maintained required a ruling in his favor. Accordingly, respondent\n\nclearly consented to the trial court\u2019s review of the issue pursuant to section 205 and cannot now\n\nclaim, for the first time, that the court\u2019s doing so was error.\n\n\u00b6 40           We reiterate that, when the trial court granted the GAL\u2019s motion to amend the\n\npetition to add a citation to section 205 of the Act and the court stated it was proceeding under\n\nsection 205, respondent (1) made no contemporaneous objection and (2) failed to argue the court\n\nproceeded in error in a postjudgment motion. (Indeed, respondent made no reference to section\n\n309 until he filed his brief with this court.) Had respondent raised his claims of error with the trial\n\n\n\n                                                    -9-\n\fcourt, the court could have had the opportunity to make any necessary corrections to its judgment.\n\nSee People v. Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d 598, 612, 939 N.E.2d 403, 413 (2010) (\u201cWe have stressed the\n\nimportance of applying the forfeiture rule uniformly except in compelling situations because\n\nfailure to raise a claim properly denies the trial court an opportunity to correct an error ***, thus\n\nwasting time and judicial resources.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 41            The importance of honoring the rationale underlying procedural default is\n\nparticularly true in this case, which involves the application of complex facts to a technical statute\n\nin the context of contested parentage in a juvenile neglect case. The trial court should have been\n\napprised of the alleged errors and been given the chance to correct them, if necessary. This court\n\ndeclines respondent\u2019s request to reverse the trial court based upon the complex, technical issues\n\nraised in this case for the first time on appeal.\n\n\u00b6 42                                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 43            For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\u00b6 44            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 10 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">             NOTICE                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (4th) 220115-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n This Order was filed under\n                                                                                    FILED\n                                          NO. 4-22-0115                             July 8, 2022\n Supreme Court Rule 23 and is\n                                                                                   Carla Bender\n not precedent except in the                                                   4th District Appellate\n limited circumstances allowed     IN THE APPELLATE COURT\n                                                                                     Court, IL\n under Rule 23(e)(1).\n                                           OF ILLINOIS\n\n                                       FOURTH DISTRICT\n\n     In re J.R. and J.A., Minors                                )     Appeal from the\n                                                                )     Circuit Court of\n     (The People of the State of Illinois,                      )     McLean County\n                   Petitioner-Appellee,                         )     No. 20JA59\n                   v.                                           )\n     Michael A.,                                                )     Honorable\n                   Respondent-Appellant).                       )     J.

(born May 2011) and J.R. (born July 2009). In May 2020, the State filed\n\na petition for adjudication of wardship, alleging (1) J.A. and J.R. were neglected, (2) Kayla L. was\n\ntheir mother, and (3) Scott R. was their putative father. (The petition alleged that respondent was\n\nthe putative father of two other minors who are not the subject of this appeal.) That same day, the\n\ntrial court ordered paternity testing of J.A. and J.R. In June 2020, DNA test results were filed with\n\nthe court showing that Scott R. was the biological father of J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b63              In August 2020, the trial court adjudicated J.A. and J.R. neglected. In July 2021,\n\nthe State filed a motion to terminate the parental rights of Kayla L. and Scott R. In November\n\f2021, before the termination proceedings were held, the guardian ad litem (GAL) filed a \u201cMotion\n\nfor Declaration of Non-Existence of the Parent Child Relationship and Determination of Paternity\u201d\n\nas to J.A. and J.R., which sought to invalidate the VAPs signed by respondent as to those two\n\nminors. In January 2022, the trial court granted the GAL\u2019s motion and discharged respondent as a\n\nparty to the proceedings.\n\n\u00b64             Respondent appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by (1) applying section 205\n\nof the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015 (Act) (750 ILCS 46/205 (West 2020)) rather than section 309\n\nof the Act (id. \u00a7 309) when determining the GAL\u2019s motion to declare the nonexistence of a\n\nparent-child relationship between respondent and J.A. and J.R. and (2) granting the GAL\u2019s motion\n\nbecause the GAL did not meet the requirements of section 309 that she (a) designate her motion a\n\n\u201cpetition\u201d and (b) make a showing of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. Respondent argues\n\nin the alternative that, if the court was correct to apply section 205, the GAL\u2019s motion still fails\n\nbecause she did not designate her motion a \u201cpetition.\u201d We conclude that respondent has forfeited\n\nthese arguments by failing to raise them in the trial court and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\u00b65                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b66                                     A. Procedural History\n\n\u00b67                           1. The Petition and Adjudicatory Hearing\n\n\u00b68             In May 2020, the State filed a petition for adjudication of wardship, alleging J.A.\n\n(born May 2011), and J.R. (born July 2009), were neglected in that their environment was injurious\n\nto their welfare when they resided with (1) their mother, Kayla L., due to her \u201cunresolved issues\n\nof domestic violence and/or anger management\u201d and \u201calcohol and/or substance abuse\u201d and\n\n(2) their putative father, Scott R., due to his \u201cunresolved issues of domestic violence and/or anger\n\nmanagement.\u201d 705 ILCS 405/2-3(1)(b) (West 2020). (We note respondent was not named as a\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fputative father of J.A. and J.R. Respondent was included in the petition as the putative father of\n\ntwo other children he shared with Kayla L., namely R.A. (born September 2015) and K.A. (born\n\nOctober 2013).)\n\n\u00b69             That same day, the trial court conducted a shelter care hearing and placed temporary\n\ncustody of the minors with the guardianship administrator of DCFS. The court also entered an\n\norder for paternity testing of J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b6 10           In June 2020, the results of DNA testing were filed with the court, showing Scott\n\nR. was the biological father of J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b6 11           In August 2020, the trial court conducted an adjudicatory hearing and adjudicated\n\nJ.A. and J.R. neglected.\n\n\u00b6 12                                2. The Dispositional Hearing\n\n\u00b6 13           In October 2020, the trial court conducted a dispositional hearing and entered a\n\nwritten order finding Kayla L. and Scott R. to be unfit for reasons other than financial\n\ncircumstances alone to care for, protect, train, educate, supervise, or discipline J.A. and J.R. and\n\nthat placement with Kayla L. or Scott R. would be contrary to the health, safety, and best interests\n\nof J.A. and J.R. The court placed custody and guardianship of J.A. and J.R. with the guardianship\n\nadministrator of DCFS and set the permanency goal as \u201creturn home [in] 12 months.\u201d (We note\n\nthat, at the same hearing, the court found respondent fit as to R.A. and K.A. and awarded him\n\ncustody. At the next hearing, the court awarded respondent guardianship of R.A. and K.A.,\n\nterminated their wardship, and closed their portion of the case.)\n\n\u00b6 14                       3. The Voluntary Acknowledgements of Paternity\n\n\u00b6 15           In July 2021, caseworker Natasha Bever of the Center for Youth and Family\n\nSolutions (CYFS) filed a permanency report regarding J.A. and J.R. In her report, Bever wrote that\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fshe had \u201creceived two separate [VAPs] indicating [respondent] is the legal father of [J.R. and\n\nJ.A.].\u201d Bever further reported that she had spoken to a worker in the child support division who\n\nadvised that \u201cwhile there are paternity results as well as an order in a previous family court case\n\ninvolving [Scott R. and J.R.], there is very specific language that would need to be used in a court\n\nmotion to vacate the VAPs and that has never been completed.\u201d Bever attached the VAPs to her\n\nreport. The VAPs demonstrated that respondent executed and filed a VAP as to J.A. in May 2011\n\nand a VAP as to J.R. in July 2009.\n\n\u00b6 16                              4. The Termination Proceedings\n\n\u00b6 17           Later in July 2021, the State filed a motion for termination of Kayla L. and Scott\n\nR.\u2019s parental rights as to J.A. and J.R.\n\n\u00b6 18           In September 2021, the trial court entered an order finding Kayla L. and Scott R.\n\nunfit for failing to make reasonable progress toward the return home of the minors during the\n\nnine-month period alleged in the motion to terminate parental rights.\n\n\u00b6 19           In November 2021, Bever filed a best-interest report with the trial court. In the\n\n\u201cRecommendations\u201d section of her report, she requested that the parental rights of Kayla L. and\n\n\u201cbiological father\u201d Scott R. be terminated and also that the parental rights of \u201clegal father,\u201d\n\nrespondent, be terminated.\n\n\u00b6 20           B. The Motion to Declare the Non-Existence of Parent-Child Relationship\n\n\u00b6 21                                       1. The Motion\n\n\u00b6 22           Later in November 2021, the GAL filed a \u201cMotion for Declaration of\n\nNon-Existence of the Parent Child Relationship and Determination of Paternity.\u201d The motion\n\nalleged that (1) J.A. and J.R. were born when respondent and Kayla L. were in a relationship and\n\n(2) respondent signed voluntary acknowledgements of paternity for each minor. The motion\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\ffurther alleged that, as part of the present case, Scott R. was determined to be the biological father\n\nof J.A. and J.R. Accordingly, the motion alleged, \u201cit is in [J.A. and J.R.\u2019s] best interest to identify\n\ntheir genetic father and for them to have only one father. It is not in [J.A. and J.R.\u2019s] best interest\n\nthat [respondent] be designated the legal father based on the [VAP].\u201d The motion requested,\n\ntherefore, that the court \u201cdeclare the non-existence of the father and child relationship between\n\n[respondent and J.A. and J.R.] and declar[e] [Scott R.] is the biological father of [J.A. and J.R.]\n\nand that [respondent] be removed as a part[y] to this proceeding.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 23                               2. The Hearing on the Motion\n\n\u00b6 24           In January 2022, the trial court conducted a hearing on the GAL\u2019s motion. At the\n\nbeginning of the hearing, respondent, through his counsel, asked the court to find that the GAL\u2019s\n\nmotion was facially void because it cited to a section of a repealed version of the Illinois Parentage\n\nAct (750 ILCS 45/11(f)(3) (West 2014) (repealed by Pub. Act 99-85, \u00a7 977 (eff. Jan. 1, 2016))).\n\nThe GAL asked for leave to amend the motion to (1) strike paragraph six, which cited to language\n\nfrom the repealed statute regarding a presumption of paternity based on DNA testing and (2) add\n\nto paragraph five a citation to section 205 of the current version of the Act (750 ILCS 46/205 (West\n\n2020)). The court granted the GAL\u2019s oral motion to amend and clarified that the proceedings\n\n\u201cregarding the non-existence of the parentage relationship\u201d would be held pursuant to section 205.\n\nRespondent did not object to the motion to amend or the court\u2019s proceeding under section 205.\n\n\u00b6 25                                 a. The Evidence Presented\n\n\u00b6 26           Next, the GAL requested the trial court take judicial notice of (1) the DNA results\n\nfiled in June 2020, showing, with a probability of 99.99%, that Scott R. was the father of J.A. and\n\nJ.R., (2) an order of paternity entered by the court in July 2020, naming Scott R. as the father of\n\nJ.A. and J.R., based on the DNA results, and (3) the VAPs executed by respondent as to J.A. and\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fJ.R. in 2011 and 2009, respectively. The court took judicial notice of the requested documents\n\nwithout objection by respondent. No other evidence was presented by any party.\n\n\u00b6 27                              b. The Arguments of the Parties\n\n\u00b6 28           The GAL then argued that, based on the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in In re\n\nA.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3165894\"><a href=\"/opinion/3165894/in-re-aa/\">2015 IL 118605</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">43 N.E.3d 947</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u201cbefore you can argue whether or not it\u2019s in the best interest\n\nof the minor for there to be an order declaring non-existence of the parent child relationship, you\n\nmust first *** either establish paternity or disestablish paternity.\u201d The GAL further argued that,\n\nbased on the documents the trial court judicially noticed, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that paternity has already\n\nbeen established. The father of these boys is [Scott R.], is not [respondent].\u201d The GAL asked the\n\ncourt to \u201cvacate the VAPs that were filed previously\u201d and \u201center an order disestablishing paternity\n\nbetween each of these boys and [respondent].\u201d\n\n\u00b6 29           Respondent argued that the issue before the trial court was \u201cwhether or not there\n\nexists a parent child relationship in this case between [respondent and J.A. and J.R.]\u201d Respondent\n\nasserted it was clear that respondent was a father to the boys \u201cin all ways that matter,\u201d noting that\n\nrespondent was in the hospital at their birth, raised them, took them to practices, helped with\n\nschoolwork, and took care of their \u201cactivities of daily living.\u201d Respondent also argued that when\n\nhe signed the VAPs, he voluntarily assumed responsibility of being a parent to the children and\n\nagreed to forego any further inquiry into whether or not he was the children\u2019s biological father.\n\nRespondent continued, \u201cAnd, just as it would be unreasonable to allow [respondent] later based\n\nsolely on DNA to get out of that responsibility, *** this court should not grant the [GAL\u2019s] motion\n\nto basically have a termination hearing through this motion where the burden is different.\u201d\n\nRespondent then argued that pursuant to section 204(b) of the Act (720 ILCS 46/204(b) (West\n\n2020)), if conflicting presumptions of paternity arose under section 204, the court could resolve\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fthat conflict by considering the minors\u2019 best interests. Respondent claimed it would be contrary to\n\nJ.A. and J.R.\u2019s best interests to vacate the VAPs and \u201cmake [them] orphans.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30                                c. The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n\n\u00b6 31           Following the arguments of the parties, the trial court observed that A.A. \u201cuses the\n\nold statutory provisions,\u201d but \u201cwe know the Parentage Act controls.\u201d The court observed that\n\nsection 205(c) of the Act permits the court to \u201cdirect the mother, child and alleged father to submit\n\nto DNA tests to determine inherited characteristics.\u201d The court noted that it ordered such testing,\n\nand the results were on file in this case, showing that Scott R. \u201ccannot be excluded as the biological\n\nfather of the children.\u201d The court continued as follows:\n\n                       \u201c[W]hile there is a voluntary acknowledgement that has been signed by\n\n               [respondent], *** we now have DNA testing that shows [respondent] is not the\n\n               biological father, because [Scott R.] has been established as the father. Orders were\n\n               entered in this court [in July 2020] as referred by [the GAL.] There was no dispute\n\n               made of the DNA tests at the time or objections to the entry of those orders.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 32           The trial court further noted that the birth certificates of J.A. and J.R., which were\n\non record in the present case, showed respondent as the father of J.A. and Scott R. as the father of\n\nJ.R. As a result, the court observed, there were inconsistencies in the birth certificates and the\n\nVAPs and \u201cthis is a legal determination that needs to be made.\u201d The court stated as follows:\n\n                       \u201c[The] Parentage Act contains no express requirement that a court consider\n\n               the best interest of the child before any testing is conducted or a legal determination\n\n               of paternity is made. The first step in the proceeding is to establish or disestablish\n\n               parentage. And that\u2019s what we did in this case. We established that [Scott R.] was\n\n               the father of these children. Once parentage has been established, then the trial court\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f               is charged with the responsibility of deciding other issues which surround paternity,\n\n               including custody and visitation, issues that we may take up in the context of this\n\n               JA case.\n\n                       So the first step is paternity, and that\u2019s been done, and [Scott R.] is the\n\n               father. [Respondent] is not, based upon those results. So, I think [the GAL] has\n\n               established in her motion that there is no, I don\u2019t want to say no relationship, but\n\n               there is no\u2014we have a legal\u2014we have a biological father, and that\u2019s been\n\n               established. That\u2019s sufficient enough based upon case law in looking at this legal\n\n               issue to disestablish or determine the non-existence of [respondent\u2019s] relationship\n\n               with these two children.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 33           On this basis, the trial court granted the GAL\u2019s motion.\n\n\u00b6 34           That same day, the trial court also entered a written order granting the GAL\u2019s\n\nmotion. The court found that respondent \u201cwas designated the legal father of the minor[s] based in\n\n[sic] his execution of Voluntary Acknowledgements of Paternity whereby he claimed to be the\n\nminors\u2019 biological father,\u201d but in July 2020, \u201cthis court found that [Scott R.] was the biological\n\nfather of the minors.\u201d As a result, the court found, respondent \u201cis not the legal father [of J.A. and\n\nJ.R.] and that the VAPs are null and void and he is discharged as a party.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 35           This appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 36                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 37           Respondent appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by (1) applying section 205\n\nof the Act (750 ILCS 46/205 (West 2020)) rather than section 309 of the Act (id. \u00a7 309) when\n\ndetermining the GAL\u2019s motion to declare the nonexistence of a parent-child relationship between\n\nrespondent and J.A. and J.R. and (2) granting the GAL\u2019s motion because the GAL did not meet\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\fthe requirements of section 309 that (a) she designate her motion a \u201cpetition\u201d and (b) make a\n\nshowing of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. Respondent argues in the alternative that, if\n\nthe court was correct to apply section 205, the GAL\u2019s motion still fails because she did not\n\ndesignate her motion a \u201cpetition.\u201d We conclude that respondent has forfeited these arguments by\n\nfailing to raise them in the trial court and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\u00b6 38           \u201cTo preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must, even in child custody\n\ncases, object at trial and file a written posttrial motion addressing it.\u201d In re Chance H., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019 IL\n\nApp (1st) 180053</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 45, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">139 N.E.3d 88</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In the present case, respondent did not raise any of the\n\nissues he brings on appeal at any time before the trial court\u2014neither at the hearing on the GAL\u2019s\n\nmotion nor in a postjudgment motion. Because respondent is raising these issues for the first time\n\non appeal, review of the issues is forfeited. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\u00b6 39           We note that respondent did not merely forfeit his argument by failing to argue in\n\nthe trial court that section 309 of the Act controls, but, instead, stood silent when the court\n\npermitted the GAL to amend its motion to seek invalidation of the VAPs pursuant to section 205.\n\nFurther, respondent argued to the trial court that section 204 applied to the extent competing\n\npresumptions existed, which he maintained required a ruling in his favor. Accordingly, respondent\n\nclearly consented to the trial court\u2019s review of the issue pursuant to section 205 and cannot now\n\nclaim, for the first time, that the court\u2019s doing so was error.\n\n\u00b6 40           We reiterate that, when the trial court granted the GAL\u2019s motion to amend the\n\npetition to add a citation to section 205 of the Act and the court stated it was proceeding under\n\nsection 205, respondent (1) made no contemporaneous objection and (2) failed to argue the court\n\nproceeded in error in a postjudgment motion. (Indeed, respondent made no reference to section\n\n309 until he filed his brief with this court.) Had respondent raised his claims of error with the trial\n\n\n\n                                                    -9-\n\fcourt, the court could have had the opportunity to make any necessary corrections to its judgment.\n\nSee People v.

The trial court should have been\n\napprised of the alleged errors and been given the chance to correct them, if necessary.

Affirmed.\n\n\u00b62     Respondent, Christopher P., appeals from the trial court\u2019s order finding that he was an unfit\n\nparent. The court also found that it was in the best interests of his minor children that respondent\u2019s\n\nparental rights be terminated. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\n\u00b64     Respondent has four children with the same mother. In December 2018, the children were\n\nplaced in shelter care and temporary guardianship was granted to the Illinois Department of\n\nChildren and Family Services (DCFS). At that time, all were living together with respondent\u2019s\n\nmother. In February 2019, the court adjudicated the children neglected. In May 2019, the court\n\nfound both parents unfit and adjudicated the children wards of the court. DCFS became involved\n\nfollowing reports of inadequate food and shelter, as well as domestic violence and mental health\n\nissues in the home.\n\n\u00b65     DCFS ordered respondent to cooperate and comply with the terms of a service plan. The\n\nplan required respondent to comply with the following requirements: complete a substance abuse\n\nevaluation; attend individual counseling; participate in a mental health assessment; complete a\n\ncourt-ordered psychological evaluation; participate in a court-ordered parenting capacity\n\nassessment; cooperate with prescribed parenting services; provide support and suitable housing\n\nfor his children; and obtain full employment. Respondent\u2019s compliance with the plan\u2019s\n\nrequirements was evaluated on November 25, 2019; his compliance was generally rated\n\n\u201cunsatisfactory\u201d for failure to engage in services.\n\n\u00b66     DCFS prepared a subsequent compliance report after respondent was evaluated again on\n\nMay 11, 2020. According to that report, respondent completed four drug screenings from\n\nDecember 2019 to February 7, 2020, and tested positive for marijuana three times; engaged in a\n\nmental health evaluation in March 2020; joined a waitlist for parenting education; continued to\n\nreside in the same residence; reported working but failed to provide proof of employment; and was\n\ndenied referral for a court-ordered parenting capacity assessment and psychological evaluation due\n\nto substance use. Both evaluations were completed by Alisha Stewart.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\n\u00b67     In December 2020, the State filed a petition for termination of both parents\u2019 parental rights\n\npursuant to section 50/1(D) of the Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1(D) (West 2020)), identifying the\n\nrelevant time period as May 8, 2019, through February 8, 2020. A trial on that motion took place\n\nin October 2021. Only respondent\u2019s parental rights are at issue in this appeal.\n\n\u00b68                                A. Alisha Stewart\u2019s Testimony\n\n\u00b69     Alisha Stewart, a foster caseworker with Camelot Agency, testified that she took over the\n\nchildren\u2019s case in August 2019. She did not speak with the prior caseworker (who no longer\n\nworked at Camelot), but gathered information from service providers and her supervisor for the\n\nperiod before she took over. She attempted to contact respondent monthly by phone but was\n\nunsuccessful, thus she did not speak to him until January 2020. Stewart met with both parents and\n\nverified that they understood the services they were required to complete. The parents had been\n\ncontinually involved with DCFS since 2017 due to reports of inadequate food and shelter, as well\n\nas domestic violence and mental health issues in the home.\n\n\u00b6 10   During the period of May 2019 through November 2019, respondent\u2019s compliance with\n\nthe service plan was rated \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d He had not kept in regular contact with either Stewart\n\nor Camelot. His rating during this period was due to failure to participate services, a consequence\n\nof his failure to keep in contact with the agency. In January 2020, he reported working out of state\n\nduring this period to Stewart, but he had not documented his employment status. He was referred\n\nfor mental health services and a parenting capacity assessment, but Stewart received no\n\ndocumentation that he completed those services; she explained, \u201cThere was concern of substance\n\nabuse services not being completed.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 11   Respondent tested positive for THC three times between December 2019 and February\n\n2020. Although he started outpatient treatment for substance abuse at Nicasa, he was discharged\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\ndue to failure to attend. He was attending therapy through Camelot as of March 2020 and was rated\n\nsatisfactory for mental health services. Although respondent was referred to and eligible for\n\nparenting education through Nicasa, he had not yet completed that service. Instead, he was on a\n\nwaitlist to complete classes through Camelot as of March 2020. The agency was unwilling to begin\n\ncoaching until respondent was consistent with mental health services, however, despite his rating\n\nof satisfactory.\n\n\u00b6 12    Respondent stated that his address continued to be the residence from which the children\n\nwere removed. Although he reported working out of state, he did not provide an out-of-state\n\naddress. Stewart could not recall whether she had visited respondent\u2019s stated address but did say\n\nshe had not been inside the residence.\n\n\u00b6 13    Respondent was offered weekly supervised visitation; he attended 6 and missed 17\n\nscheduled visitations. While he engaged with his children, respondent showed limited parenting\n\nskills and it appeared he did not understand child development. For instance,\n\n        \u201c[T]here were limited parenting skills demonstrated. It appeared he did not understand\n\n        child development as he would tell the children they were going home soon and telling\n\n        them he did all this paperwork so the kids could come home. He was not consistent in\n\n        providing snacks or meals during his visitation.\u201d\n\nTo Stewart\u2019s knowledge, the assertion that respondent had done everything required, and that all\n\nhe had to do before they could return home was complete paperwork, was not true. During the\n\ntransition period in which she took over the case, Stewart was aware of visits in August 2019 and\n\nSeptember 2019, though she had not supervised them. Visitation was suspended in December 2019\n\nbased on visitation inconsistency, though respondent continued to express his desire to see his\n\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\n\u00b6 14   Respondent had not sufficiently cooperated in his prescribed services for visitation to be\n\nreinstated. She recalled that respondent brought birthday gifts during one visit but could not recall\n\nwhether he gave Christmas gifts. He told Stewart he had Christmas gifts for the children, but\n\npreferred to wait to give them in person. He had not otherwise provided financial support for the\n\nchildren. His visitation was reinstated in September 2020.\n\n\u00b6 15                                B. Respondent\u2019s Testimony\n\n\u00b6 16   Respondent testified after Stewart. Prior to the removal of his children, respondent had an\n\nintact caseworker named Peter Sajovec who had asked him to undergo a mental health screening,\n\na psychological evaluation, and a substance abuse evaluation.\n\n\u00b6 17   His children were removed from his care while they were living in a trailer home owned\n\nby his mother. His mother, the children\u2019s mother, and a woman named Becky also lived there. The\n\nresidence had two bedrooms and there were five pets\u2014two dogs and three cats. Respondent still\n\nlived at that residence and had never moved out.\n\n\u00b6 18   After DCFS took custody of the children, respondent became involved with a caseworker\n\nfrom Camelot named Sarah who \u201crefused to call [respondent] back\u201d and \u201crefused to tell [him]\n\nanything.\u201d He was later assigned a new caseworker who \u201cdid not keep up to date with [him].\u201d\n\nRespondent did not receive a copy of the service plan until June 2019, six months after the children\n\nwere removed.\n\n\u00b6 19   Respondent worked out of state (in Minnesota) from April 2019 to December 2019 and did\n\nnot complete any services during this time. He told his caseworker he was going to be working out\n\nof state. Aside from one visit on May 25, 2019, he did not visit the children during this time because\n\nhe \u201ccouldn\u2019t.\u201d Stewart \u201ctook the visitations away\u201d from him. The only proof of employment he\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\nprovided to Stewart was a copy of a letter from his employer stating that he was paid in cash. He\n\nworked 12 to 14 hours per day, 6 days per week, on cell phone towers.\n\n\u00b6 20   Respondent contacted his caseworker when he returned in December 2019. He completed\n\n\u201cthe drug class\u201d in March or April 2020. When asked if it was possible that he merely underwent\n\nan evaluation in March and completed treatment in October 2020, respondent agreed. He said he\n\ndid not test positive for cannabis when tested by Stewart and Nicasa. Respondent never completed\n\nparenting classes; he \u201ccouldn\u2019t find a parenting place\u201d and was told by Stewart that he was not\n\napproved. He completed a psychological evaluation but did not have proof.\n\n\u00b6 21                              C. The Trial Court\u2019s Findings\n\n\u00b6 22   After reviewing the procedural history of the case, the trial court made its findings and\n\nconcluded that the State had proved respondent was unfit:\n\n              \u201cThe Court\u2019s aware that [respondent], sometime after his visits were suspended in\n\n       December of 2019, became a little more consistent with the caseworker, began asking for\n\n       visitation with the children; but his actions speak louder than his words.\n\n              Here, based upon all of the evidence, [respondent] failed to do tasks and services\n\n       in any timely fashion or form; failed to regularly visit the children prior to his visits being\n\n       suspended; left the state for eight months to work, April/May of 2019 to December of 2019;\n\n       failed to appear on court dates; failed to consistently -- you know, prior to his visits being\n\n       suspended, consistently communicate and cooperate with caseworker; had knowledge of\n\n       the tasks and services; and misled the children at visits.\n\n              The Court finds the State has met its burden of proof by clear and convincing\n\n       evidence that Mr. Purpura failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest or concern or\n\n       responsibility for the four minor children.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\n                                               ***\n\n             As to all children and as to each minor child, the nine-month period alleged by the\n\n      State is May 8th of 2019 to February 8th of 2020. During this nine-month period, the Court\n\n      finds that the parents weren\u2019t regularly exercising their visits, were not completing all their\n\n      tasks and services, were rated unsatisfactory, you know, during that nine-month period.\n\n      The permanency order of July 16th of 2019 indicates that no parent was making any\n\n      progress or involved in any tasks and services. So that would cover from May 8th of 2019\n\n      to when the June period began, June to December.\n\n             The December permanency order, again no progress. Neither parent completing\n\n      tasks and services. [Respondent] not regularly visiting the children, not involved in tasks\n\n      and services. His own testimony was that he had knowledge of the service plan in June of\n\n      2019. His own testimony was that he did not do tasks and services. The caseworker\u2019s\n\n      testimony was that she tried to reach out to him, left messages. Visits were suspended in\n\n      December of 2019. He had no visits other than the six visits, as identified in the review\n\n      period of June 19th to December of 2019.\n\n             The Court recognizes that [respondent], you know, had a substance abuse\n\n      evaluation and was doing some mental health services, but he was discharged from both\n\n      for not attending. But those occurred in -- The evaluation, it wasn\u2019t clear, it might have\n\n      been February or March. But he didn\u2019t do the services up until February 8th. And he wasn\u2019t\n\n      completed with mental health services from May 8th of 2019 to February 8th of 2020.\n\n             The Court notes during that time frame the lack of completing all tasks and services,\n\n      the lack of maintaining a bond and relationship with the children, the failure to appear on\n\n      court dates by [respondent]. The Court finds that [respondent] did not make reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\n        progress towards return home of the children during that nine-month period as alleged by\n\n        the State. The children weren\u2019t close or near in the future to be returned home to\n\n        [respondent].\u201d\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 23                                        II. ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 24    At issue is whether the trial court erred in finding respondent unfit. Every case involving a\n\nfinding that a parent is unfit is sui generis. In re Adoption of Syck, 138 Ill. 2d 255, 278 (1990). A\n\nparent may be found unfit on the ground that he or she has \u201cfail[ed] to maintain a reasonable degree\n\nof interest, concern or responsibility as to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d 750 ILCS 50/1(D)(b) (West 2020).\n\nThe State meets its burden by presenting clear and convincing evidence that a parent is unfit. Syck,\n\n138 Ill. 2d at 278. If a child has been adjudicated a neglected minor, a parent may be found unfit\n\nif, during any nine-month period following such adjudication, he or she failed \u201cto make reasonable\n\nprogress toward the return of the child to the parent.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1(D)(m)(ii) (West 2020). Whether a\n\nparent has made \u201creasonable progress\u201d is judged objectively and requires \u201cmeasurable or\n\ndemonstrable movement toward the goal of reunification.\u201d In re Jacorey, 2012 IL App (1st)\n\n113427, \u00b6 21. The \u201cbenchmark\u201d for determining whether a parent has made reasonable progress\n\ntoward the return of the child \u201cencompasses the parent\u2019s compliance with the service plans and the\n\ncourt\u2019s directives, in light of the condition which gave rise to the removal of the child\u201d and \u201cother\n\nconditions which later become known and which would prevent the court from returning custody\n\nof the child to the parent.\u201d In re C.N., 196 Ill. 2d at 216\u201317; see also 750 ILCS 50/1(D)(m) (West\n\n2020) (\u201c \u2018[F]ailure to make reasonable progress toward the return of the child to the parent\u2019\n\nincludes the parent\u2019s failure to substantially fulfill his or her obligations under the service plan[.]\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\nA finding that either of the above grounds is satisfied can support a finding of unfitness. See 750\n\nILCS 50/1(D) (West 2020) (\u201cThe grounds of unfitness are any one or more of the following***.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 25   A trial court\u2019s finding of unfitness will be reversed only if it is against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence. In re Adoption of L.T.M., 214 Ill. 2d 60, 68 (2005). We defer to the findings of the\n\ntrial court because it is in the best position to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses. In re\n\nD.F., 201 Ill. 2d 476, 498-99 (2002). A finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence if is\n\nunreasonable, arbitrary, or not based on the evidence presented. Id. at 498. Focusing on only the\n\nground alleging failure to make reasonable progress (which is sufficient to reach a decision), we\n\nconclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 26   Respondent argues that the trial court erred in finding him unfit. First, he contends that\n\nthere was not clear and convincing evidence that he failed to maintain a reasonable degree of\n\ninterest, concern, and responsibility for the children. Specifically, he claims his failure to visit his\n\nchildren \u201cwas motivated by a need to cope with the other aspects of his life\u201d in that he had to leave\n\nthe state for eight months to work from April 2019 to December 2019. See Syck, 138 Ill. 2d at 279.\n\nSecond, he contends that the evidence presented at trial did not establish by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that he had not made reasonable progress toward the return of his children. Specifically,\n\nhe claims that Stewart had no personal knowledge of whether he was referred for services or\n\nwhether he might have reached a goal established by DCFS without following specific directives.\n\n\u00b6 27   We reject respondent\u2019s arguments and conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that\n\nrespondent failed to make reasonable progress toward the return of his children during the period\n\nof May 8, 2019, and February 8, 2020, was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 28   Respondent\u2019s children were adjudicated neglected in February 2019 and adjudicated wards\n\nof the court in May 2019. After making contact with Stewart, respondent engaged with mental\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\nhealth services and received a satisfactory rating. He expressed a desire to see his children and\n\nclaimed he purchased Christmas gifts which he wished to give them in person. His visitation was\n\nreinstated in September 2020.\n\n\u00b6 29   Nevertheless, respondent\u2019s behavior during the operative time period\u2014May 8, 2019,\n\nthrough February 8, 2020\u2014supports the trial court\u2019s judgment. Respondent testified that he last\n\nsaw his children during a May 25, 2019, visit before he returned to Illinois in December 2019 from\n\nworking out- of state. He received a copy of his service plan in June 2019, although he had been\n\nasked prior to the children\u2019s removal by a different caseworker to engage with some of the services\n\ndescribed in the service plan. He was aware that Camelot was handling his case and spoke with an\n\ninitial caseworker named Sarah, though he claimed she refused to return his calls. He was assigned\n\na second caseworker before Stewart took over. He spoke to Stewart for the first time when he\n\nreturned to Illinois in December 2019.\n\n\u00b6 30   After making contact with Stewart, respondent tested positive for THC three times between\n\nDecember 2019 and February 7, 2020. He was also discharged from drug counseling classes\n\nthrough Nicasa for failure to attend. This led Camelot to place him on a wait list to receive\n\nparenting services. Moreover, respondent testified that he continued to live in the same home under\n\nthe same conditions from which his children were removed (despite the service plan requiring him\n\nto provide suitable housing for the children), and Stewart testified that respondent provided no\n\nfinancial support for the children (aside from purchasing Christmas gifts).\n\n\u00b6 31   Although respondent argues that he needed to work out of state to cope with other aspects\n\nof his life, this proffered justification does not excuse his lack of progress toward the return of his\n\nchildren prior to February 8, 2020. Setting aside that the only documentation of his employment\n\nwas a letter purportedly from his employer stating that he was paid in cash, respondent fails to\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\nexplain why he could not work closer to his children or otherwise visit them regularly for\n\napproximately six months between June 2019 and December 2019. 1 Moreover, Stewart\u2019s lack of\n\ndirect knowledge regarding when respondent had first been referred for services and what progress\n\nhe had made prior to making contact with him is of little relevance. Defendant testified directly\n\nthat, prior to speaking with Stewart, he last saw his children on May 25, 2019, and received a copy\n\nof his service plan in June 2019. Accordingly, his failure to visit his children or engage with\n\nservices from June 2019 until December 2019 is attributable to his own lack of effort.\n\n\u00b6 32   Respondent did not cure his failure to engage in services specified in the service plan during\n\nthis period upon his return to Illinois. He was unable to promptly begin parenting services after\n\nreturning due to positive drug tests and poor substance abuse treatment attendance. His inability\n\nto begin parenting services is significant given Stewart\u2019s testimony that respondent showed limited\n\nparenting skills and understanding of child development. He also failed to obtain suitable housing\n\nor provide financial support to the children. The totality of respondent\u2019s circumstances thus show\n\na lack of reasonable progress toward reunification. See 750 ILCS 50/1(D)(m)(ii) (West 2020); In\n\nre C.N., 196 Ill. 2d at 216\u201317.\n\n\u00b6 33                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 34   For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Lake County.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The record is unclear as to whether respondent visited his children between May 25, 2019,\n\nand December 2019. Stewart testified that she was aware of two visits during August 2019 and\n\nSeptember 2019, but respondent testified that he did not visit the children during that time frame.\n\nThe trial court recognized this discrepancy, however, and stated that it gave respondent the benefit\n\nof the doubt, ostensibly finding that those two visits occurred. We accept this finding.\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U\n\n\n\u00b6 35   Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            - 12 -\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                          No. 2-22-0056\n                                      Order filed July 8, 2022\n\n      NOTICE: This order was filed under Supreme Court Rule 23(b) and is not\n      precedent except in the limited circumstances allowed under Rule 23(e)(1).\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                              IN THE\n\n                               APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n                              SECOND DISTRICT\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nIn re A.P., K.P., L.P., and J.P., Minors) Appeal from the Circuit Court\n                                        ) of Lake County.\n                                        )\n                                        ) No. 20-JA-344\n                                        ) No. 20-JA-345\n                                        ) No. 20-JA-346\n                                        ) No. 20-JA-347\n                                        )\n(The People of the State of Illinois,   ) Honorable\nPetitioner-Appellee, v.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n\u00b63                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\u00b64     Respondent has four children with the same mother. In December 2018, the children were\n\nplaced in shelter care and temporary guardianship was granted to the Illinois Department of\n\nChildren and Family Services (DCFS). At that time, all were living together with respondent\u2019s\n\nmother. In February 2019, the court adjudicated the children neglected. In May 2019, the court\n\nfound both parents unfit and adjudicated the children wards of the court. DCFS became involved\n\nfollowing reports of inadequate food and shelter, as well as domestic violence and mental health\n\nissues in the home.\n\n\u00b65     DCFS ordered respondent to cooperate and comply with the terms of a service plan. The\n\nplan required respondent to comply with the following requirements: complete a substance abuse\n\nevaluation; attend individual counseling; participate in a mental health assessment; complete a\n\ncourt-ordered psychological evaluation; participate in a court-ordered parenting capacity\n\nassessment; cooperate with prescribed parenting services; provide support and suitable housing\n\nfor his children; and obtain full employment. Respondent\u2019s compliance with the plan\u2019s\n\nrequirements was evaluated on November 25, 2019; his compliance was generally rated\n\n\u201cunsatisfactory\u201d for failure to engage in services.\n\n\u00b66     DCFS prepared a subsequent compliance report after respondent was evaluated again on\n\nMay 11, 2020. According to that report, respondent completed four drug screenings from\n\nDecember 2019 to February 7, 2020, and tested positive for marijuana three times; engaged in a\n\nmental health evaluation in March 2020; joined a waitlist for parenting education; continued to\n\nreside in the same residence; reported working but failed to provide proof of employment; and was\n\ndenied referral for a court-ordered parenting capacity assessment and psychological evaluation due\n\nto substance use. Both evaluations were completed by Alisha Stewart.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\u00b67     In December 2020, the State filed a petition for termination of both parents\u2019 parental rights\n\npursuant to section 50/1(D) of the Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1(D) (West 2020)), identifying the\n\nrelevant time period as May 8, 2019, through February 8, 2020. A trial on that motion took place\n\nin October 2021. Only respondent\u2019s parental rights are at issue in this appeal.\n\n\u00b68                                A. Alisha Stewart\u2019s Testimony\n\n\u00b69     Alisha Stewart, a foster caseworker with Camelot Agency, testified that she took over the\n\nchildren\u2019s case in August 2019. She did not speak with the prior caseworker (who no longer\n\nworked at Camelot), but gathered information from service providers and her supervisor for the\n\nperiod before she took over. She attempted to contact respondent monthly by phone but was\n\nunsuccessful, thus she did not speak to him until January 2020. Stewart met with both parents and\n\nverified that they understood the services they were required to complete. The parents had been\n\ncontinually involved with DCFS since 2017 due to reports of inadequate food and shelter, as well\n\nas domestic violence and mental health issues in the home.\n\n\u00b6 10   During the period of May 2019 through November 2019, respondent\u2019s compliance with\n\nthe service plan was rated \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d He had not kept in regular contact with either Stewart\n\nor Camelot. His rating during this period was due to failure to participate services, a consequence\n\nof his failure to keep in contact with the agency. In January 2020, he reported working out of state\n\nduring this period to Stewart, but he had not documented his employment status. He was referred\n\nfor mental health services and a parenting capacity assessment, but Stewart received no\n\ndocumentation that he completed those services; she explained, \u201cThere was concern of substance\n\nabuse services not being completed.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 11   Respondent tested positive for THC three times between December 2019 and February\n\n2020. Although he started outpatient treatment for substance abuse at Nicasa, he was discharged\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\ndue to failure to attend. He was attending therapy through Camelot as of March 2020 and was rated\n\nsatisfactory for mental health services. Although respondent was referred to and eligible for\n\nparenting education through Nicasa, he had not yet completed that service. Instead, he was on a\n\nwaitlist to complete classes through Camelot as of March 2020. The agency was unwilling to begin\n\ncoaching until respondent was consistent with mental health services, however, despite his rating\n\nof satisfactory.\n\n\u00b6 12    Respondent stated that his address continued to be the residence from which the children\n\nwere removed. Although he reported working out of state, he did not provide an out-of-state\n\naddress. Stewart could not recall whether she had visited respondent\u2019s stated address but did say\n\nshe had not been inside the residence.\n\n\u00b6 13    Respondent was offered weekly supervised visitation; he attended 6 and missed 17\n\nscheduled visitations. While he engaged with his children, respondent showed limited parenting\n\nskills and it appeared he did not understand child development. For instance,\n\n        \u201c[T]here were limited parenting skills demonstrated. It appeared he did not understand\n\n        child development as he would tell the children they were going home soon and telling\n\n        them he did all this paperwork so the kids could come home. He was not consistent in\n\n        providing snacks or meals during his visitation.\u201d\n\nTo Stewart\u2019s knowledge, the assertion that respondent had done everything required, and that all\n\nhe had to do before they could return home was complete paperwork, was not true. During the\n\ntransition period in which she took over the case, Stewart was aware of visits in August 2019 and\n\nSeptember 2019, though she had not supervised them.

She recalled that respondent brought birthday gifts during one visit but could not recall\n\nwhether he gave Christmas gifts. He told Stewart he had Christmas gifts for the children, but\n\npreferred to wait to give them in person. He had not otherwise provided financial support for the\n\nchildren. His visitation was reinstated in September 2020.\n\n\u00b6 15                                B. Respondent\u2019s Testimony\n\n\u00b6 16   Respondent testified after Stewart. Prior to the removal of his children, respondent had an\n\nintact caseworker named Peter Sajovec who had asked him to undergo a mental health screening,\n\na psychological evaluation, and a substance abuse evaluation.\n\n\u00b6 17   His children were removed from his care while they were living in a trailer home owned\n\nby his mother. His mother, the children\u2019s mother, and a woman named Becky also lived there. The\n\nresidence had two bedrooms and there were five pets\u2014two dogs and three cats. Respondent still\n\nlived at that residence and had never moved out.\n\n\u00b6 18   After DCFS took custody of the children, respondent became involved with a caseworker\n\nfrom Camelot named Sarah who \u201crefused to call [respondent] back\u201d and \u201crefused to tell [him]\n\nanything.\u201d He was later assigned a new caseworker who \u201cdid not keep up to date with [him].\u201d\n\nRespondent did not receive a copy of the service plan until June 2019, six months after the children\n\nwere removed.\n\n\u00b6 19   Respondent worked out of state (in Minnesota) from April 2019 to December 2019 and did\n\nnot complete any services during this time. He told his caseworker he was going to be working out\n\nof state. Aside from one visit on May 25, 2019, he did not visit the children during this time because\n\nhe \u201ccouldn\u2019t.\u201d Stewart \u201ctook the visitations away\u201d from him.

He\n\nworked 12 to 14 hours per day, 6 days per week, on cell phone towers.\n\n\u00b6 20   Respondent contacted his caseworker when he returned in December 2019. He completed\n\n\u201cthe drug class\u201d in March or April 2020. When asked if it was possible that he merely underwent\n\nan evaluation in March and completed treatment in October 2020, respondent agreed. He said he\n\ndid not test positive for cannabis when tested by Stewart and Nicasa. Respondent never completed\n\nparenting classes; he \u201ccouldn\u2019t find a parenting place\u201d and was told by Stewart that he was not\n\napproved. He completed a psychological evaluation but did not have proof.\n\n\u00b6 21                              C. The Trial Court\u2019s Findings\n\n\u00b6 22   After reviewing the procedural history of the case, the trial court made its findings and\n\nconcluded that the State had proved respondent was unfit:\n\n              \u201cThe Court\u2019s aware that [respondent], sometime after his visits were suspended in\n\n       December of 2019, became a little more consistent with the caseworker, began asking for\n\n       visitation with the children; but his actions speak louder than his words.\n\n              Here, based upon all of the evidence, [respondent] failed to do tasks and services\n\n       in any timely fashion or form; failed to regularly visit the children prior to his visits being\n\n       suspended; left the state for eight months to work, April/May of 2019 to December of 2019;\n\n       failed to appear on court dates; failed to consistently -- you know, prior to his visits being\n\n       suspended, consistently communicate and cooperate with caseworker; had knowledge of\n\n       the tasks and services; and misled the children at visits.\n\n              The Court finds the State has met its burden of proof by clear and convincing\n\n       evidence that Mr. Purpura failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest or concern or\n\n       responsibility for the four minor children.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n                                               ***\n\n             As to all children and as to each minor child, the nine-month period alleged by the\n\n      State is May 8th of 2019 to February 8th of 2020. During this nine-month period, the Court\n\n      finds that the parents weren\u2019t regularly exercising their visits, were not completing all their\n\n      tasks and services, were rated unsatisfactory, you know, during that nine-month period.\n\n      The permanency order of July 16th of 2019 indicates that no parent was making any\n\n      progress or involved in any tasks and services. So that would cover from May 8th of 2019\n\n      to when the June period began, June to December.\n\n             The December permanency order, again no progress. Neither parent completing\n\n      tasks and services. [Respondent] not regularly visiting the children, not involved in tasks\n\n      and services. His own testimony was that he had knowledge of the service plan in June of\n\n      2019. His own testimony was that he did not do tasks and services. The caseworker\u2019s\n\n      testimony was that she tried to reach out to him, left messages. Visits were suspended in\n\n      December of 2019. He had no visits other than the six visits, as identified in the review\n\n      period of June 19th to December of 2019.\n\n             The Court recognizes that [respondent], you know, had a substance abuse\n\n      evaluation and was doing some mental health services, but he was discharged from both\n\n      for not attending. But those occurred in -- The evaluation, it wasn\u2019t clear, it might have\n\n      been February or March. But he didn\u2019t do the services up until February 8th. And he wasn\u2019t\n\n      completed with mental health services from May 8th of 2019 to February 8th of 2020.\n\n             The Court notes during that time frame the lack of completing all tasks and services,\n\n      the lack of maintaining a bond and relationship with the children, the failure to appear on\n\n      court dates by [respondent]. The Court finds that [respondent] did not make reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n        progress towards return home of the children during that nine-month period as alleged by\n\n        the State.

Focusing on only the\n\nground alleging failure to make reasonable progress (which is sufficient to reach a decision), we\n\nconclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 26   Respondent argues that the trial court erred in finding him unfit. First, he contends that\n\nthere was not clear and convincing evidence that he failed to maintain a reasonable degree of\n\ninterest, concern, and responsibility for the children. Specifically, he claims his failure to visit his\n\nchildren \u201cwas motivated by a need to cope with the other aspects of his life\u201d in that he had to leave\n\nthe state for eight months to work from April 2019 to December 2019. See Syck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2153560\"><a href=\"/opinion/2153560/in-re-adoption-of-syck/\">138 Ill. 2d at 279</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nSecond, he contends that the evidence presented at trial did not establish by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that he had not made reasonable progress toward the return of his children. Specifically,\n\nhe claims that Stewart had no personal knowledge of whether he was referred for services or\n\nwhether he might have reached a goal established by DCFS without following specific directives.\n\n\u00b6 27   We reject respondent\u2019s arguments and conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that\n\nrespondent failed to make reasonable progress toward the return of his children during the period\n\nof May 8, 2019, and February 8, 2020, was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 28   Respondent\u2019s children were adjudicated neglected in February 2019 and adjudicated wards\n\nof the court in May 2019. After making contact with Stewart, respondent engaged with mental\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nhealth services and received a satisfactory rating. He expressed a desire to see his children and\n\nclaimed he purchased Christmas gifts which he wished to give them in person. His visitation was\n\nreinstated in September 2020.\n\n\u00b6 29   Nevertheless, respondent\u2019s behavior during the operative time period\u2014May 8, 2019,\n\nthrough February 8, 2020\u2014supports the trial court\u2019s judgment. Respondent testified that he last\n\nsaw his children during a May 25, 2019, visit before he returned to Illinois in December 2019 from\n\nworking out- of state. He received a copy of his service plan in June 2019, although he had been\n\nasked prior to the children\u2019s removal by a different caseworker to engage with some of the services\n\ndescribed in the service plan. He was aware that Camelot was handling his case and spoke with an\n\ninitial caseworker named Sarah, though he claimed she refused to return his calls. He was assigned\n\na second caseworker before Stewart took over. He spoke to Stewart for the first time when he\n\nreturned to Illinois in December 2019.\n\n\u00b6 30   After making contact with Stewart, respondent tested positive for THC three times between\n\nDecember 2019 and February 7, 2020. He was also discharged from drug counseling classes\n\nthrough Nicasa for failure to attend. This led Camelot to place him on a wait list to receive\n\nparenting services. Moreover, respondent testified that he continued to live in the same home under\n\nthe same conditions from which his children were removed (despite the service plan requiring him\n\nto provide suitable housing for the children), and Stewart testified that respondent provided no\n\nfinancial support for the children (aside from purchasing Christmas gifts).\n\n\u00b6 31   Although respondent argues that he needed to work out of state to cope with other aspects\n\nof his life, this proffered justification does not excuse his lack of progress toward the return of his\n\nchildren prior to February 8, 2020. Setting aside that the only documentation of his employment\n\nwas a letter purportedly from his employer stating that he was paid in cash, respondent fails to\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nexplain why he could not work closer to his children or otherwise visit them regularly for\n\napproximately six months between June 2019 and December 2019. 1 Moreover, Stewart\u2019s lack of\n\ndirect knowledge regarding when respondent had first been referred for services and what progress\n\nhe had made prior to making contact with him is of little relevance. Defendant testified directly\n\nthat, prior to speaking with Stewart, he last saw his children on May 25, 2019, and received a copy\n\nof his service plan in June 2019. Accordingly, his failure to visit his children or engage with\n\nservices from June 2019 until December 2019 is attributable to his own lack of effort.\n\n\u00b6 32   Respondent did not cure his failure to engage in services specified in the service plan during\n\nthis period upon his return to Illinois. He was unable to promptly begin parenting services after\n\nreturning due to positive drug tests and poor substance abuse treatment attendance. His inability\n\nto begin parenting services is significant given Stewart\u2019s testimony that respondent showed limited\n\nparenting skills and understanding of child development. He also failed to obtain suitable housing\n\nor provide financial support to the children. The totality of respondent\u2019s circumstances thus show\n\na lack of reasonable progress toward reunification. See 750 ILCS 50/1(D)(m)(ii) (West 2020); In\n\nre C.N., 196 Ill. 2d at 216\u201317.\n\n\u00b6 33                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 34   For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Lake County.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The record is unclear as to whether respondent visited his children between May 25, 2019,\n\nand December 2019. Stewart testified that she was aware of two visits during August 2019 and\n\nSeptember 2019, but respondent testified that he did not visit the children during that time frame.\n\nThe trial court recognized this discrepancy, however, and stated that it gave respondent the benefit\n\nof the doubt, ostensibly finding that those two visits occurred. We accept this finding.\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2022 IL App (2d) 220056-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\u00b6 35   Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            - 12 -\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2153560/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2096812/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2046954/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/6498954/", "id": 6498954, "absolute_url": "/opinion/6622596/people-v-eason/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/6622596/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2022-07-08T14:03:31.475209-07:00", "date_modified": "2022-07-08T14:55:58.027310-07:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "827a21c667a2ac8645bbec15ef2a69076aa16e53", "page_count": 14, "download_url": "https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/resources/9884a38f-fff1-466c-b6a3-5002e7d75e12/file", "local_path": "pdf/2022/07/08/people_v._eason.pdf", "plain_text": "                                   2022 IL App (1st) 200471-U\n\n                                                                              FIFTH DIVISION\n                                                                         Order filed: July 8, 2022\n\n                                          No. 1-20-0471\n\n NOTICE: This order was filed under Supreme Court Rule 23 and is not precedent except in the\n limited circumstances allowed under Rule 23(e)(1).\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                             IN THE\n\n                                APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n                                 FIRST DISTRICT\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n\n THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,                        )   Appeal from the\n                                                             )   Circuit Court of\n        Respondent-Appellee,                                 )   Cook County.\n                                                             )\n v.                                                          )   No. 2004 CR 17601 02\n                                                             )\n HANNIBAL EASON,                                             )   Honorable\n                                                             )   Lawrence E.

At trial, the State\u2019s theory of the case was that the defendant and Billy\n\nJohnson followed the victim, William Jones, off a bus to rob him, and that Johnson fatally shot\n\nJones during the encounter. Joyce O\u2019Neil, a bystander on the bus, testified that, on the night of the\n\nshooting, she saw the defendant and two companions\u2014later identified as Johnson and Allen\n\nFaulkner\u2014near the victim at a bus stop. She stated that she boarded a bus with all four men. She\n\nrecalled that the defendant, who appeared to have a hearing impairment, was \u201clooking at\u201d the\n\nvictim while they waited at the bus stop and \u201cstaring at\u201d the victim during the bus ride. O\u2019Neil said\n\nthat the defendant began \u201cfrantic[ally]\u201d communicating in sign language with Johnson during the\n\nbus ride, while Faulkner talked to other passengers. She also recalled that one of the three men in\n\nthe defendant\u2019s group had a bottle of alcohol sticking partly out of a pants pocket. O\u2019Neil left the\n\nbus at the same time as the three men and the victim, and she saw the defendant and Johnson\n\n\u201cwalking fast\u201d to follow the victim, while Faulkner remained uninvolved. The victim, the\n\ndefendant, and Johnson disappeared behind a white van, and O\u2019Neil then heard three gunshots.\n\n\u00b65     Faulkner testified (through the use of American Sign Language (ASL) and an interpreter)\n\nthat the defendant and Johnson, among other people, gathered at his house on the day of the\n\nshooting, and, during the gathering, Johnson showed a gun to the group. After an initial denial,\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nFaulkner agreed when confronted with his grand jury testimony that he had seen the defendant\n\nhold the gun during the gathering. Faulkner said that Johnson told the group he planned to commit\n\na robbery. Faulkner declined to participate, \u201cso [Johnson] asked [the defendant] [\u2018]you want to go\n\nrob somebody.\u2019 They started talking.\u201d At that point, Faulkner said, he left the room.\n\n\u00b66     Faulkner said that he, Johnson, and the defendant consumed vodka Johnson had brought in\n\na gallon jug and smoked marijuana before leaving Faulkner\u2019s home. Later in the night, the group\n\nof three men boarded a bus and saw the victim. At that point in the night, Faulkner said, the\n\ndefendant was carrying the vodka bottle in a bag. Faulkner testified that, on the bus, \u201cit looked like\n\n[Johnson] was messing with [the victim] and [he and the defendant] [were] trying to talk about\n\nrobbing [him] and they [were] looking at him, making him afraid.\u201d Faulkner, however, focused\n\nhis attention on talking to other passengers. When the four got off the bus, Faulkner continued to\n\ntalk to other people, but he saw Johnson and the defendant chase the victim. According to Faulkner,\n\nthe defendant \u201cwhacked the guy\u201d with the vodka bottle. The victim then put his hands up, a\n\nstruggle ensued, and flashes of gunfire emanated from the area. The defendant and Johnson ran\n\nsoon thereafter, and Faulkner also ran when he saw that the victim had been killed. Faulkner said\n\nthat he saw the defendant and Johnson later at his house. Despite being confronted with his grand\n\njury testimony stating the opposite, Faulkner denied having seen the defendant go through the\n\nvictim\u2019s clothes after the shooting. However, he confirmed that he saw the defendant with a\n\ncellular phone after the shooting. On cross-examination, Faulkner stated that he did not recall\n\ntelling police that the defendant was not involved in the shooting.\n\n\u00b67     Cedric Currin (also testifying in ASL through an interpreter), one of the people who\n\ngathered at Faulkner\u2019s house prior to the shooting, recalled that Johnson was showing his gun to\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nother people at the house. According to Currin, the defendant \u201creally checked the gun out. He was\n\nreally analyzing it.\u201d Currin later saw Johnson and the defendant talking to each other. Currin left\n\nthe home wondering if he should alert others to the possible trouble.\n\n\u00b68     Andrew Buchanan (likewise testifying with the assistance of an interpreter), another person\n\nat the gathering, testified that the defendant seemed impressed by the gun. Buchanan disagreed\n\nwith his prior grand jury testimony, in which he said that the defendant reacted to the gun by saying\n\n\u201cI feel like robbing somebody.\u201d He also denied knowing that the defendant and Johnson agreed to\n\ncommit a robbery, despite so testifying before the grand jury. Buchanan, who was at Faulkner\u2019s\n\nhome after the incident as well, testified that the defendant returned with a cellular phone, but he\n\nsaid that the defendant did not explain where he obtained the phone. However, Buchanan was\n\nagain impeached by his grand jury testimony that the defendant admitted taking the phone from\n\nthe victim.\n\n\u00b69     Troy Williams, a police officer who was off duty at the time of the shooting, testified that\n\nhe saw the defendant and Johnson following the victim and then heard three gunshots. Williams,\n\nhowever, did not see the actual shooting. The parties stipulated that, if called as a witness, a\n\nmedical examiner would testify that he observed gunshot wounds on the victim\u2019s body, as well as\n\nlacerations on the front and back of the victim\u2019s head.\n\n\u00b6 10   At the close of the State\u2019s case, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed\n\nverdict, and the defense rested after presenting a stipulation that a police detective would testify\n\nthat Faulkner told him the defendant was not involved in the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 11   Following closing arguments and deliberation, the jury returned its verdict finding the\n\ndefendant guilty of first degree murder and armed robbery. The court sentenced the defendant to\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n38 years in prison. We affirmed the judgment on direct appeal. See Eason, 2012 IL App (1st)\n\n092927-U.\n\n\u00b6 12   In 2014, the defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition raising numerous claims for\n\nrelief. The postconviction court appointed counsel for the defendant, who filed a supplemental\n\npetition raising eleven more claims for relief, as well as a subsequent addendum to the supplement.\n\nAmong the many claims filed by the defendant and postconviction counsel, only two are at issue\n\nin this appeal. The first relates to the use of grand jury testimony as impeachment material at the\n\ndefendant\u2019s trial. Three of the witnesses at the trial, Faulkner, Buchanan, and Currin, are either\n\ndeaf or hard of hearing (as is the defendant) and testified at both the grand jury proceeding and the\n\ntrial in American Sign Language (ASL). However, the defendant asserted in his petition that the\n\nASL interpretation procedures used at the grand jury proceeding were insufficient to produce\n\nreliable testimony, rendering the grand jury testimony of the three witnesses inadmissible at trial.\n\nThe defendant claimed in the petition that the use of that grand jury testimony at trial violated his\n\nrights to due process and equal protection. Alternatively, the defendant claimed that trial counsel\n\nrendered ineffective assistance by not objecting to the use of the grand jury testimony. In the\n\nsecond claim at issue in this appeal, the defendant asserted that his appellate counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance by not arguing that the trial court had failed to comply with Supreme Court\n\nRule 431(b) during jury selection by not properly explaining all four principles contained in the\n\nrule and by not asking the venire if they understood and accepted those principles.\n\n\u00b6 13   The State moved to dismiss the defendant\u2019s postconviction petition. Following argument\n\non the State\u2019s motion, the postconviction court granted the motion and dismissed the defendant\u2019s\n\npetition in its entirety. The defendant now appeals the dismissal of his petition, specifically\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\ncontesting the dismissal of the two claims concerning the use of grand jury testimony and the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s noncompliance with Rule 431(b).\n\n\u00b6 14    In noncapital cases, the Act provides for three separate stages. At the first stage, the\n\npostconviction court examines the petition to determine if it is frivolous or patently without merit\n\nand dismisses the petition if it qualifies as either. People v. Johnson, 2021 IL 125738, \u00b6 24. If the\n\npetition survives the first stage, it then moves on to the second stage, where the court may appoint\n\ncounsel, who may then amend or supplement the defendant\u2019s original petition. Id. \u00b6 27. The State\n\nmay then file a motion to dismiss, and the court may hold a hearing on that motion. Id. When\n\nevaluating a petition at the second stage, \u201cthe circuit court must determine whether the petition\n\nand any accompanying documentation make \u2018a substantial showing of a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPeople v. Tate, 2012 IL 112214, \u00b6 10 (quoting People v. Edwards, 197 Ill. 2d 239, 246 (2001)). If\n\nthe petition survives the second stage, it proceeds to a third-stage evidentiary hearing. Johnson,\n\n2021 IL 125738, \u00b6 27. The court in this case dismissed the defendant\u2019s petition at the second stage\n\nfollowing a motion to dismiss filed by the State. We review such an order de novo, showing \u201cno\n\ndeference to the postconviction court\u2019s judgment or reasoning.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 15    The first claim at issue on appeal consists of two parts: a primary argument that the use of\n\ngrand jury testimony at trial violated the defendant\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection,\n\nand an alternative argument that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the use of the grand jury\n\ntestimony amounted to ineffective assistance. However, we do not reach the merits of either\n\nargument because the defendant forfeited this claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal. 1\n\n\n\n\n        1\n         The defendant did not raise a second alternative argument that, in event of forfeiture, appellate\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal, so we do not address that possibility.\n\n                                                     -6-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 16   \u201cThe purpose of a postconviction proceeding is to permit inquiry into constitutional issues\n\ninvolved in the original conviction and sentence that were not, and could not have been,\n\nadjudicated previously on direct appeal.\u201d People v. English, 2013 IL 112890, \u00b6 22 (citing People\n\nv. Harris, 206 Ill. 2d 1, 12 (2002)). \u201c[I]ssues that could have been raised on direct appeal, but were\n\nnot, are forfeited.\u201d Id. (citing People v. Ligon, 239 Ill. 2d 94, 103 (2010)). This rule applies to the\n\nclaim presently at issue regardless of whether it is viewed as an alleged violation of due process\n\nor equal protection (see, e.g., People v. Newman, 365 Ill. App. 3d 285, 289 (4th Dist. 2006)) or\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel (see, e.g., People v. Veach, 2017 IL 120649, \u00b6 46).\n\n\u00b6 17   However, the forfeiture doctrine may be relaxed \u201cwhere fundamental fairness so requires,\n\nwhere the forfeiture stems from the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, or where the facts\n\nrelating to the issue do not appear on the face of the original appellate record.\u201d English, 2013 IL\n\n112890, \u00b6 22 (citing People v. Williams, 209 Ill. 2d 227, 233 (2004)). Indeed, the defendant in this\n\ncase argues that the basis for the claim did not appear in the original appellate record and, therefore,\n\nwas not forfeited. But we find this argument belied by the record.\n\n\u00b6 18   At the core of this first claim are three alleged infirmities in the grand jury testimony that\n\nthe defendant asserts undermine the reliability of the testimony taken at that proceeding. First, the\n\ndefendant notes that only one interpreter handled the grand jury proceedings, rather than the team\n\nof at least seven interpreters who worked the defendant\u2019s trial. Citing an Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act handbook, the defendant contends that the use of a single interpreter increases the\n\nrisk of inaccurate interpretations due to interpreter fatigue. He also explains that the use of multiple\n\ninterpreters allows the interpreters to confer and resolve possible areas of confusion in an\n\ninterpretation, as happened at trial on at least one occasion.\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 19    Second, the defendant asserted that the record did not contain the qualifications of the\n\ninterpreter who handled the grand jury proceeding. He claims that it is important to know whether\n\nthe interpreter was a Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI), a more specialized class of interpreter whose\n\npresence, the defendant contends, is necessary to ensure the level of accuracy required in legal\n\nsettings.\n\n\u00b6 20    Third, the defendant noted that the grand jury proceeding was not videotaped, leaving the\n\nparties and the court with no ability to rewatch the proceeding to verify the accuracy of the\n\ninterpreted testimony as it was reflected in the written transcript.\n\n\u00b6 21    However, all of these alleged infirmities were apparent in the original appellate record.\n\nFirst, the written transcript of the grand jury proceeding demonstrated that only one interpreter was\n\npresent. The introductory pages listing the parties who were present listed only one interpreter,\n\nand in the body of the testimony only one interpreter was sworn in. Second, the absence of the\n\ninterpreter\u2019s credentials and qualifications was similarly apparent from the transcript of the grand\n\njury proceeding, which did not contain any mention of the interpreter\u2019s credentials or any\n\nindication that the interpreter was a CDI. Third, the lack of videotaping was self-evident; if there\n\nwas no videotape in the record and no comment in the transcript about the proceeding being\n\nvideotaped, it would have been safe to assume that no tape existed.\n\n\u00b6 22    The defendant counters with two points of rebuttal. First, he contends that the State\n\nforfeited the ability to raise forfeiture in this appeal by not raising that argument below. However,\n\nthe State did raise forfeiture below, asserting in its motion to dismiss that the defendant\u2019s due-\n\nprocess, equal-protection, and ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims were forfeited\n\nbecause they could have been raised on direct appeal. The State also argued at the hearing on the\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nmotion to dismiss that all ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims and issues related to the\n\ninterpretation of the grand jury testimony were apparent from the record and, therefore, should\n\nhave been raised on direct appeal. Accordingly, the State did not forfeit this argument.\n\n\u00b6 23   Second, the defendant alleges that this claim relied on scholarly authorities that were not\n\npresent in the original record, and he contends that Illinois law would have prevented him from\n\nsupplementing the record with those authorities. See, e.g., People v. Vara, 2018 IL 121823, \u00b6 22\n\n(noting that \u201c[a]mendment of the record is not to be used as a device for inserting extraneous\n\nmaterials into the record on appeal\u201d). However, a party may cite non-legal scholarly authorities in\n\nsupport of an argument regardless of whether those authorities are in the record on appeal. See In\n\nre M.M., 156 Ill. 2d 53, 56 (1993) (\u201c[Supreme Court Rule 341] expresses no restriction on the\n\nnature or source of material which may be cited in support of an argument. Whether the authority\n\ncited may be nonprecedential, irrelevant, or incomplete will be determined by the reviewing court\n\nas a proper consideration in assessing the merits of a proponent\u2019s argument.\u201d); In re Marriage of\n\nSchmitt, 391 Ill. App. 3d 1010, 1017 (2d Dist. 2009) (noting that parties may cite secondary\n\nauthorities in support of their arguments); see also People v. McKown, 226 Ill. 2d 245, 273\u201374\n\n(2007) (considering a group of scientific papers cited as supporting authority). There was no need\n\nfor the defendant to rely on only authorities contained in the record, and he could have brought\n\nthis claim on direct appeal with citations to scientific or scholarly authorities supporting his\n\narguments regarding the unreliability of the grand jury testimony. Therefore, because the basis for\n\nthe claim was apparent in the original appellate record, the defendant forfeited his claim regarding\n\nthe use of grand jury testimony by not raising it on direct appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 24    The second claim at issue in this appeal concerns the trial court\u2019s alleged noncompliance\n\nwith Supreme Court Rule 431(b). That rule requires the trial court to ask during jury selection\n\nwhether each potential juror understands and accepts four principles concerning (1) the\n\npresumption of innocence, (2) proof beyond a reasonable doubt, (3) the defendant\u2019s right to not\n\npresent evidence on his or her behalf, and (4) the defendant\u2019s right to not testify in his or her\n\ndefense. See id. In his postconviction petition, the defendant claimed that appellate counsel\n\nrendered ineffective assistance by not arguing that the trial court failed to comply with the\n\nrequirements of Rule 431(b) by entirely omitting any reference to the third and fourth principles\n\nand by failing to adequately ask whether the prospective jurors understood and accepted all four\n\nprinciples. The postconviction court denied this claim on the merits, finding that the defendant\n\nfailed to demonstrate ineffective assistance.\n\n\u00b6 25    \u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are measured against the same\n\nstandard as those dealing with ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\u201d People v. Childress, 191 Ill.\n\n2d 168, 175 (2000). That is, the defendant \u201cmust show that the failure to raise an issue on direct\n\nappeal was objectively unreasonable and that the decision prejudiced [the defendant].\u201d Id. (citing\n\nPeople v. West, 187 Ill. 2d 418, 435 (1999)). In order to demonstrate prejudice, the defendant must\n\nshow that the issue would have been meritorious. Id. Accordingly, an answer to the prejudice\n\ninquiry requires a determination of whether the underlying claim of trial court error \u201cwould have\n\nbeen successful if raised on direct appeal.\u201d Id. In other words, to determine if a defendant was\n\nprejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise an issue, we must review the issue as though it\n\nwere being raised on direct appeal and determine whether the defendant\u2019s argument would have\n\nresulted in relief. See id.\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 26    The defendant in this case asserted in his petition that, because trial counsel forfeited the\n\nissue on appeal by not objecting or otherwise raising any complaint regarding the trial court\u2019s\n\nnoncompliance with Rule 431(b) (see People v. Stuckey, 2011 IL App (1st) 092535, \u00b6 28),\n\nappellate counsel should have raised the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 431(b) as plain\n\nerror, a doctrine that allows for appellate review of unpreserved errors. Because a claim of\n\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel requires the defendant to prove that appellate counsel\n\nhad a meritorious argument to raise, the defendant in this case must show that the trial court\u2019s\n\nalleged violation of Rule 431(b) did indeed amount to plain error, thereby establishing that the\n\ndefendant was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue. See Childress, 191 Ill.\n\n2d at 175 (\u201cUnless the underlying issue is meritorious, petitioner suffered no prejudice from\n\ncounsel's failure to raise it on direct appeal.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 27    The plain-error doctrine allows a reviewing court to consider an unpreserved error when\n\n        \u201c(1) a clear or obvious error occurs and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error\n\n        alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the\n\n        seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurs and that error is so serious\n\n        that it affected the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial and challenged the integrity of the\n\n        judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\u201d People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill.\n\n        2d 551, 565 (2007).\n\nThe defendant\u2019s claim in this case focuses on the first of these prongs, arguing that the trial court\n\ncommitted a clear error and that the evidence was so closely balanced that the error threatened to\n\ntip the balance of the scales of justice against the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     - 11 -\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 28   The first step in a first-prong plain-error analysis is to determine whether the trial court\n\ncommitted a clear or obvious error. See People v. Belknap, 2014 IL 117094, \u00b6 41. The State in this\n\ncase concedes on this point and acknowledges that the trial court failed to comply with the\n\nrequirements of Rule 431(b) by not addressing the third principle and by not asking the prospective\n\njurors if they understood and accepted the four principles. Our focus, therefore, is solely on the\n\nsecond component of the analysis, whether the defendant was prejudiced by the error.\n\n\u00b6 29   In order to demonstrate prejudice, the defendant must show that the evidence was closely\n\nbalanced. See People v. Sebby, 2017 IL 119445, \u00b6 51 (explaining that when a defendant establishes\n\nthat the evidence was so closely balanced that the court\u2019s noncompliance with Rule 431(b)\n\nthreatened to tip the scales of justice the defendant has shown that the error was actually\n\nprejudicial); Belknap, 2014 IL 117094, \u00b6 62 (finding no prejudice from the trial court\u2019s failure to\n\ncomply with Rule 431(b) when the evidence was not closely balanced). \u201cIn determining whether\n\nthe evidence adduced at trial was close, a reviewing court must evaluate the totality of the evidence\n\nand conduct a qualitative, commonsense assessment of it within the context of the case.\u201d Sebby,\n\n2017 IL 119445, \u00b6 53 (citing Belknap, 2014 IL 117094, \u00b6\u00b6 52\u201353). The defendant carries the\n\nburden of establishing first-prong plain error. Id. \u00b6 51.\n\n\u00b6 30   Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that the evidence was not so closely\n\nbalanced that the trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the prospective jurors on the Rule 431(b)\n\nprinciples threatened to tip the scales of justice. Joyce O\u2019Neil, an unbiased bystander, testified that\n\nshe saw the defendant \u201clooking at\u201d the victim while they waited for the bus and \u201cstaring at\u201d the\n\nvictim during the bus ride. According to O\u2019Neil, the defendant at one point switched seats to be\n\ndirectly behind the victim and \u201cfrantic[ally]\u201d communicated in sign language with Johnson during\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nthe bus ride. O\u2019Neil got off the bus at the same time as the defendant, Johnson, and the victim, and\n\nshe saw the defendant and Johnson \u201cwalking fast\u201d to follow the victim. Soon after the three men\n\ndisappeared behind a white van, O\u2019Neil heard three gunshots.\n\n\u00b6 31   Even if we were to ignore Faulkner\u2019s and Buchanan\u2019s grand jury testimony regarding the\n\ndefendant\u2019s alleged interest in Johnson\u2019s gun and the defendant\u2019s alleged desire to participate in a\n\nrobbery or shooting (testimony that the defendant maintains was unreliable), O\u2019Neil\u2019s testimony\n\nalone provided strong evidence that the defendant was a willing participant in the murder, and the\n\ndefendant has not pointed to any exculpatory evidence of substantially similar weight to make the\n\ncase closely balanced. Instead, he notes the absence of physical evidence, the lack of a confession,\n\nand the existence of inconsistencies in the testimony of other witnesses, primarily Faulkner, on\n\nother matters. But these points do not undermine O\u2019Neil\u2019s strongly incriminating testimony\n\ndescribing the events leading to the murder, testimony that was, where possible, corroborated by\n\nbus surveillance video. And if we were to add in the testimony provided by Faulkner, Buchanan,\n\nand Currin suggesting that the defendant had expressed a keen interest in engaging in a robbery or\n\nshooting, the picture only becomes bleaker for the defendant.\n\n\u00b6 32   Because the evidence was not closely balanced, the defendant has failed to carry his burden\n\nof proving plain error. See Belknap, 2014 IL 117094, \u00b6 62. Consequently, the defendant has failed\n\nto demonstrate that he had meritorious issue to raise on direct appeal concerning the trial court\u2019s\n\nnoncompliance with Rule 431(b) and, therefore, has failed to show ineffective assistance of\n\nappellate counsel regarding counsel\u2019s failure to raise that issue. See People v. Bastida-Diaz, 2021\n\nIL App (1st) 191331-U, \u00b6 43 (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23) (\u201cBecause the\n\nevidence at trial was not closely balanced, there can be no plain error from the trial court's alleged\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 431(b).

At trial, the State\u2019s theory of the case was that the defendant and Billy\n\nJohnson followed the victim, William Jones, off a bus to rob him, and that Johnson fatally shot\n\nJones during the encounter. Joyce O\u2019Neil, a bystander on the bus, testified that, on the night of the\n\nshooting, she saw the defendant and two companions\u2014later identified as Johnson and Allen\n\nFaulkner\u2014near the victim at a bus stop. She stated that she boarded a bus with all four men. She\n\nrecalled that the defendant, who appeared to have a hearing impairment, was \u201clooking at\u201d the\n\nvictim while they waited at the bus stop and \u201cstaring at\u201d the victim during the bus ride. O\u2019Neil said\n\nthat the defendant began \u201cfrantic[ally]\u201d communicating in sign language with Johnson during the\n\nbus ride, while Faulkner talked to other passengers. She also recalled that one of the three men in\n\nthe defendant\u2019s group had a bottle of alcohol sticking partly out of a pants pocket. O\u2019Neil left the\n\nbus at the same time as the three men and the victim, and she saw the defendant and Johnson\n\n\u201cwalking fast\u201d to follow the victim, while Faulkner remained uninvolved. The victim, the\n\ndefendant, and Johnson disappeared behind a white van, and O\u2019Neil then heard three gunshots.\n\n\u00b65     Faulkner testified (through the use of American Sign Language (ASL) and an interpreter)\n\nthat the defendant and Johnson, among other people, gathered at his house on the day of the\n\nshooting, and, during the gathering, Johnson showed a gun to the group. After an initial denial,\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nFaulkner agreed when confronted with his grand jury testimony that he had seen the defendant\n\nhold the gun during the gathering. Faulkner said that Johnson told the group he planned to commit\n\na robbery. Faulkner declined to participate, \u201cso [Johnson] asked [the defendant] [\u2018]you want to go\n\nrob somebody.\u2019 They started talking.\u201d At that point, Faulkner said, he left the room.\n\n\u00b66     Faulkner said that he, Johnson, and the defendant consumed vodka Johnson had brought in\n\na gallon jug and smoked marijuana before leaving Faulkner\u2019s home. Later in the night, the group\n\nof three men boarded a bus and saw the victim. At that point in the night, Faulkner said, the\n\ndefendant was carrying the vodka bottle in a bag. Faulkner testified that, on the bus, \u201cit looked like\n\n[Johnson] was messing with [the victim] and [he and the defendant] [were] trying to talk about\n\nrobbing [him] and they [were] looking at him, making him afraid.\u201d Faulkner, however, focused\n\nhis attention on talking to other passengers. When the four got off the bus, Faulkner continued to\n\ntalk to other people, but he saw Johnson and the defendant chase the victim. According to Faulkner,\n\nthe defendant \u201cwhacked the guy\u201d with the vodka bottle. The victim then put his hands up, a\n\nstruggle ensued, and flashes of gunfire emanated from the area. The defendant and Johnson ran\n\nsoon thereafter, and Faulkner also ran when he saw that the victim had been killed. Faulkner said\n\nthat he saw the defendant and Johnson later at his house. Despite being confronted with his grand\n\njury testimony stating the opposite, Faulkner denied having seen the defendant go through the\n\nvictim\u2019s clothes after the shooting. However, he confirmed that he saw the defendant with a\n\ncellular phone after the shooting. On cross-examination, Faulkner stated that he did not recall\n\ntelling police that the defendant was not involved in the shooting.\n\n\u00b67     Cedric Currin (also testifying in ASL through an interpreter), one of the people who\n\ngathered at Faulkner\u2019s house prior to the shooting, recalled that Johnson was showing his gun to\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nother people at the house. According to Currin, the defendant \u201creally checked the gun out. He was\n\nreally analyzing it.\u201d Currin later saw Johnson and the defendant talking to each other. Currin left\n\nthe home wondering if he should alert others to the possible trouble.\n\n\u00b68     Andrew Buchanan (likewise testifying with the assistance of an interpreter), another person\n\nat the gathering, testified that the defendant seemed impressed by the gun. Buchanan disagreed\n\nwith his prior grand jury testimony, in which he said that the defendant reacted to the gun by saying\n\n\u201cI feel like robbing somebody.\u201d He also denied knowing that the defendant and Johnson agreed to\n\ncommit a robbery, despite so testifying before the grand jury. Buchanan, who was at Faulkner\u2019s\n\nhome after the incident as well, testified that the defendant returned with a cellular phone, but he\n\nsaid that the defendant did not explain where he obtained the phone. However, Buchanan was\n\nagain impeached by his grand jury testimony that the defendant admitted taking the phone from\n\nthe victim.\n\n\u00b69     Troy Williams, a police officer who was off duty at the time of the shooting, testified that\n\nhe saw the defendant and Johnson following the victim and then heard three gunshots. Williams,\n\nhowever, did not see the actual shooting. The parties stipulated that, if called as a witness, a\n\nmedical examiner would testify that he observed gunshot wounds on the victim\u2019s body, as well as\n\nlacerations on the front and back of the victim\u2019s head.\n\n\u00b6 10   At the close of the State\u2019s case, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed\n\nverdict, and the defense rested after presenting a stipulation that a police detective would testify\n\nthat Faulkner told him the defendant was not involved in the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 11   Following closing arguments and deliberation, the jury returned its verdict finding the\n\ndefendant guilty of first degree murder and armed robbery. The court sentenced the defendant to\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n38 years in prison. We affirmed the judgment on direct appeal. See Eason, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2012 IL App (1st)\n\n092927-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\u00b6 12   In 2014, the defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition raising numerous claims for\n\nrelief. The postconviction court appointed counsel for the defendant, who filed a supplemental\n\npetition raising eleven more claims for relief, as well as a subsequent addendum to the supplement.\n\nAmong the many claims filed by the defendant and postconviction counsel, only two are at issue\n\nin this appeal. The first relates to the use of grand jury testimony as impeachment material at the\n\ndefendant\u2019s trial. Three of the witnesses at the trial, Faulkner, Buchanan, and Currin, are either\n\ndeaf or hard of hearing (as is the defendant) and testified at both the grand jury proceeding and the\n\ntrial in American Sign Language (ASL). However, the defendant asserted in his petition that the\n\nASL interpretation procedures used at the grand jury proceeding were insufficient to produce\n\nreliable testimony, rendering the grand jury testimony of the three witnesses inadmissible at trial.\n\nThe defendant claimed in the petition that the use of that grand jury testimony at trial violated his\n\nrights to due process and equal protection. Alternatively, the defendant claimed that trial counsel\n\nrendered ineffective assistance by not objecting to the use of the grand jury testimony. In the\n\nsecond claim at issue in this appeal, the defendant asserted that his appellate counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance by not arguing that the trial court had failed to comply with Supreme Court\n\nRule 431(b) during jury selection by not properly explaining all four principles contained in the\n\nrule and by not asking the venire if they understood and accepted those principles.\n\n\u00b6 13   The State moved to dismiss the defendant\u2019s postconviction petition. Following argument\n\non the State\u2019s motion, the postconviction court granted the motion and dismissed the defendant\u2019s\n\npetition in its entirety. The defendant now appeals the dismissal of his petition, specifically\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\ncontesting the dismissal of the two claims concerning the use of grand jury testimony and the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s noncompliance with Rule 431(b).\n\n\u00b6 14    In noncapital cases, the Act provides for three separate stages. At the first stage, the\n\npostconviction court examines the petition to determine if it is frivolous or patently without merit\n\nand dismisses the petition if it qualifies as either. People v.

Id. \u00b6 27. The State\n\nmay then file a motion to dismiss, and the court may hold a hearing on that motion. Id.

Indeed, the defendant in this\n\ncase argues that the basis for the claim did not appear in the original appellate record and, therefore,\n\nwas not forfeited. But we find this argument belied by the record.\n\n\u00b6 18   At the core of this first claim are three alleged infirmities in the grand jury testimony that\n\nthe defendant asserts undermine the reliability of the testimony taken at that proceeding. First, the\n\ndefendant notes that only one interpreter handled the grand jury proceedings, rather than the team\n\nof at least seven interpreters who worked the defendant\u2019s trial. Citing an Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act handbook, the defendant contends that the use of a single interpreter increases the\n\nrisk of inaccurate interpretations due to interpreter fatigue. He also explains that the use of multiple\n\ninterpreters allows the interpreters to confer and resolve possible areas of confusion in an\n\ninterpretation, as happened at trial on at least one occasion.\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 19    Second, the defendant asserted that the record did not contain the qualifications of the\n\ninterpreter who handled the grand jury proceeding. He claims that it is important to know whether\n\nthe interpreter was a Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI), a more specialized class of interpreter whose\n\npresence, the defendant contends, is necessary to ensure the level of accuracy required in legal\n\nsettings.\n\n\u00b6 20    Third, the defendant noted that the grand jury proceeding was not videotaped, leaving the\n\nparties and the court with no ability to rewatch the proceeding to verify the accuracy of the\n\ninterpreted testimony as it was reflected in the written transcript.\n\n\u00b6 21    However, all of these alleged infirmities were apparent in the original appellate record.\n\nFirst, the written transcript of the grand jury proceeding demonstrated that only one interpreter was\n\npresent. The introductory pages listing the parties who were present listed only one interpreter,\n\nand in the body of the testimony only one interpreter was sworn in. Second, the absence of the\n\ninterpreter\u2019s credentials and qualifications was similarly apparent from the transcript of the grand\n\njury proceeding, which did not contain any mention of the interpreter\u2019s credentials or any\n\nindication that the interpreter was a CDI. Third, the lack of videotaping was self-evident; if there\n\nwas no videotape in the record and no comment in the transcript about the proceeding being\n\nvideotaped, it would have been safe to assume that no tape existed.\n\n\u00b6 22    The defendant counters with two points of rebuttal. First, he contends that the State\n\nforfeited the ability to raise forfeiture in this appeal by not raising that argument below. However,\n\nthe State did raise forfeiture below, asserting in its motion to dismiss that the defendant\u2019s due-\n\nprocess, equal-protection, and ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims were forfeited\n\nbecause they could have been raised on direct appeal. The State also argued at the hearing on the\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\nmotion to dismiss that all ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims and issues related to the\n\ninterpretation of the grand jury testimony were apparent from the record and, therefore, should\n\nhave been raised on direct appeal. Accordingly, the State did not forfeit this argument.\n\n\u00b6 23   Second, the defendant alleges that this claim relied on scholarly authorities that were not\n\npresent in the original record, and he contends that Illinois law would have prevented him from\n\nsupplementing the record with those authorities. See, e.g., People v. Vara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4364837\"><a href=\"/opinion/4587584/people-v-vara/\">2018 IL 121823</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 22\n\n(noting that \u201c[a]mendment of the record is not to be used as a device for inserting extraneous\n\nmaterials into the record on appeal\u201d). However, a party may cite non-legal scholarly authorities in\n\nsupport of an argument regardless of whether those authorities are in the record on appeal.

There was no need\n\nfor the defendant to rely on only authorities contained in the record, and he could have brought\n\nthis claim on direct appeal with citations to scientific or scholarly authorities supporting his\n\narguments regarding the unreliability of the grand jury testimony. Therefore, because the basis for\n\nthe claim was apparent in the original appellate record, the defendant forfeited his claim regarding\n\nthe use of grand jury testimony by not raising it on direct appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 1-20-0471\n\n\n\u00b6 24    The second claim at issue in this appeal concerns the trial court\u2019s alleged noncompliance\n\nwith Supreme Court Rule 431(b).

Upon arrival at the scene, he observed\n\ndefendant and a group of individuals3 in the parking lot with Hawkins. Defendant was yelling at\n\nHawkins, and people were trying to stand between them. Hawkins identified defendant as the\n\noffender and instructed him to arrest defendant. Smith informed defendant he was being charged\n\nwith \u201cbattery, disorderly.\u201d Smith attempted to place defendant in custody by reaching for his left\n\n\n\n        1\n          The record does not reveal Officer Smith\u2019s first name.\n        2\n          Defendant was acquitted of the battery charge against Hawkins and convicted of resisting a\npeace officer. Defendant does not appeal his resisting a peace officer conviction.\n        3\n          Three individuals were named codefendants in this case, which proceeded to a joint bench trial.\n\n                                                   -2-\n\fNo. 1-18-1761\n\n\narm, but defendant \u201cyanked his arm away from [him] and pushed [him] into the passenger side\n\ndoor of a car.\u201d Defendant started swinging at Smith\u2019s face using closed fists, but \u201che did not\u201d strike\n\nhis face because Smith was dodging him. Smith then punched defendant in the forehead with a\n\nclosed fist, and defendant fell to the ground where he was handcuffed.\n\n\u00b66     The State published dash camera video footage for the court. 4 The footage, which is\n\nincluded in the record on appeal, shows, in relevant part, a group of individuals arguing with\n\nseveral officers in the parking lot of the restaurant. Defendant is standing with his back to the\n\ninside of the front passenger side of a car that has its door wide open. Smith arrives on the scene\n\nand approaches defendant, who has his hands up in the air. A commotion occurs involving\n\ndefendant, the group of individuals, and several officers who are present. Smith is seen between\n\ndefendant and the open front passenger side car door while defendant\u2019s arms are moving up and\n\ndown and swinging in different directions. Smith grabs defendant\u2019s left arm and the open front\n\npassenger side car door is rocking backwards and forwards from their movement. Defendant\n\nswings towards Smith\u2019s face, who is seen ducking. After more commotion, defendant is taken\n\ndown to the ground.\n\n\u00b67     Defendant testified on his own behalf and denied swinging at any officers or intentionally\n\npushing anyone. He also denied pushing Smith into the front passenger side of a car door, and \u201cthe\n\nvideo shows you that.\u201d Defendant had his hands in the air trying to protect himself. He stated Smith\n\nattacked him, beat him down, and struck him a couple of times.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Defendant stipulated to the foundation of the dash camera video.\n\n                                                    -3-\n\fNo. 1-18-1761\n\n\n\u00b68     The trial court found defendant guilty of battery against Smith, stating \u201cwhat [it] saw on\n\nthat video was [defendant] swung. [Smith] did hit [him], but [defendant] swung at [Smith] first.\u201d\n\nIt also found defendant guilty of resisting a peace officer and not guilty of battery against Hawkins.\n\n\u00b69     Defendant filed a motion to reconsider the finding of guilt.

The trial court sentenced\n\ndefendant to 18 months\u2019 conditional discharge on each count, to be served concurrently. On appeal,\n\ndefendant argues, and the State concedes, that his battery conviction should be reversed because\n\fNo. 1-18-1761\n\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly made physical\n\ncontact of an insulting or provoking nature when he swung at but did not hit a police officer in the\n\nface. We agree and reverse defendant\u2019s battery conviction.\n\n\u00b63      The State charged defendant with two counts of battery (720 ILCS 5/12-3(a)(2) (West\n\n2016)) and one count of resisting a peace officer (720 ILCS 5/31-1(a) (West 2016)) based on his\n\nparticipation in an altercation involving Officer Smith 1 and Officer Brandon Hawkins of the\n\nMaywood Police Department. The battery counts alleged that defendant \u201cknowingly made\n\nphysical contact of an insulting nature\u201d by \u201cstriking [each officer] in the body in an attempt to\n\ndefeat arrest.\u201d The resisting a peace officer charge alleged that \u201cdefendant pushed Officer Hawkins\n\nin the body several times\u201d and \u201ccontinually pull[ed] his arms and body away in his attempt to\n\ndefeat arrest.\u201d\n\n\u00b64      We summarize the evidence adduced at trial relating to the battery charge against Smith,\n\nwhich is the only conviction appealed. 2\n\n\u00b65      Smith testified that around 1:18 a.m. on December 3, 2016, he responded to Hawkins\u2019 call\n\nfor assistance at a restaurant on West Roosevelt Road. Upon arrival at the scene, he observed\n\ndefendant and a group of individuals3 in the parking lot with Hawkins. Defendant was yelling at\n\nHawkins, and people were trying to stand between them. Hawkins identified defendant as the\n\noffender and instructed him to arrest defendant. Smith informed defendant he was being charged\n\nwith \u201cbattery, disorderly.\u201d Smith attempted to place defendant in custody by reaching for his left\n\n\n\n        1\n          The record does not reveal Officer Smith\u2019s first name.\n        2\n          Defendant was acquitted of the battery charge against Hawkins and convicted of resisting a\npeace officer. Defendant does not appeal his resisting a peace officer conviction.\n        3\n          Three individuals were named codefendants in this case, which proceeded to a joint bench trial.\n\n                                                   -2-\n\fNo. 1-18-1761\n\n\narm, but defendant \u201cyanked his arm away from [him] and pushed [him] into the passenger side\n\ndoor of a car.\u201d Defendant started swinging at Smith\u2019s face using closed fists, but \u201che did not\u201d strike\n\nhis face because Smith was dodging him. Smith then punched defendant in the forehead with a\n\nclosed fist, and defendant fell to the ground where he was handcuffed.\n\n\u00b66     The State published dash camera video footage for the court. 4 The footage, which is\n\nincluded in the record on appeal, shows, in relevant part, a group of individuals arguing with\n\nseveral officers in the parking lot of the restaurant. Defendant is standing with his back to the\n\ninside of the front passenger side of a car that has its door wide open. Smith arrives on the scene\n\nand approaches defendant, who has his hands up in the air. A commotion occurs involving\n\ndefendant, the group of individuals, and several officers who are present. Smith is seen between\n\ndefendant and the open front passenger side car door while defendant\u2019s arms are moving up and\n\ndown and swinging in different directions. Smith grabs defendant\u2019s left arm and the open front\n\npassenger side car door is rocking backwards and forwards from their movement. Defendant\n\nswings towards Smith\u2019s face, who is seen ducking. After more commotion, defendant is taken\n\ndown to the ground.\n\n\u00b67     Defendant testified on his own behalf and denied swinging at any officers or intentionally\n\npushing anyone. He also denied pushing Smith into the front passenger side of a car door, and \u201cthe\n\nvideo shows you that.\u201d Defendant had his hands in the air trying to protect himself. He stated Smith\n\nattacked him, beat him down, and struck him a couple of times.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Defendant stipulated to the foundation of the dash camera video.\n\n                                                    -3-\n\fNo. 1-18-1761\n\n\n\u00b68     The trial court found defendant guilty of battery against Smith, stating \u201cwhat [it] saw on\n\nthat video was [defendant] swung. [Smith] did hit [him], but [defendant] swung at [Smith] first.\u201d\n\nIt also found defendant guilty of resisting a peace officer and not guilty of battery against Hawkins.\n\n\u00b69     Defendant filed a motion to reconsider the finding of guilt. During the hearing on the\n\nmotion, defendant argued, \u201cthe officer\u2019s testimony[] [is] that [defendant] made no direct contact\n\nwith his face. He only swung at him. And a swing is not the same as a battery.\u201d The trial court\n\ndenied the motion, explaining it \u201cclearly saw [defendant] in the video hit Officer Smith in the\n\nface.\u201d The trial court sentenced defendant to a concurrent term of 18 months\u2019 conditional discharge\n\non the battery to Smith and resisting a peace officer counts.
